 SPR_mexican_expedition.5.d:0 "The British financial claims dated back to the end of 1851 when, at the Doyle Convention, Mexico agreed to pay 5,000,000 pesos on a 3% yearly interest rate and a 5% redeem rate. That same year, the Spanish and Mexican Government settled an old claim of 983,000 pesos (the Juarez party still hadn't recognized the 2 million dollars owed by the Santa Anna government) and additionally provided a new fund of 6,600,000 pesos. The interest rate of the first bonds was set at 3% while the latter was issued at 5%. Mexico also had similar negotiations with France in 1851 and 1853. Those claims totaled 1,759,000 pesos.\n\nThe Convention of London is a treaty signed by France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The purpose of the treaty is to agree on a course of action towards obtaining loan repayments from Mexico. The Convention of London was preceded by a quadrilateral convention in 1860, by which France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Prussia threatened intervention in Mexico unless the incapacity of its government was changed. The stalemate between the Mexican political parties, both of whose actions depended on the support of the said European nations and the United States, resulted in a six-year civil war and rendered the country bankrupt.\n\nLosing this income of interest will make our debt-situation much worse. Maybe it's time we act and ask members of the Treaty of London to support an invasion and make them pay?"
