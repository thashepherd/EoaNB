 RYU_french_gift.1.d:0 "As time passes, more European powers appear to be deeply captivated with the task of spreading their customs, culture, and religion to our great kingdom. Ever since we "opened" to the United States, other powers such as France and the United Kingdom soon followed. Many misstions were created in our great kingdom to expand their influence amoungst our people. Although incidents did  occur, they did little to stop our growing relations between us. One example in particular would be the French misstion in Naha. We had always had a strong relationship with the French and somehow they never fail to deliver. Out of the goodness of their hearts, we have been gifted many pieces of field artillery."
