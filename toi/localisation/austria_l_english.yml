His reforms were seen as the reason of such a loss, weakening the industrial potential of Austria. He leaves the position empty, and a new Interior Minister needs to be appointed.

Only God knows what the future of the Empire holds, but the Kaiser will listen to each group, listening to their demands and deciding on what's the most fair for the greater good of the Empire.

Autonomy for some, status-quo for others. Not everyone can be pleased in politics, but the Kaiser is confident that these new borders and administrations will at least buy him a few decades of peace.\n\nFor the better, or for the worst, Long Live the Federation and the Kaiser!"

While Transylvanians had relative autonomy, under a principality separate from the Hungarian crown, it still was formally administrated by the Hungarians.\n\nTransylvania could be a great candidate for full autonomy, which could stabilize the area, but also weaken Hungary. We could also keep the most Hungarian area of Szekerland in Hungaria, while giving the rest full autonomy."

Dalmatia has some of the most important ports of the Austrian Empire, so while Croatian autonomy will stabilize the Empire, it might also make Austrian presence in the Mediterranean weaker.\n\nWe could give Croatia only the non-Damaltian part of the territory they claims, but we also could let it stay inside of Hungary."

 AUSitalypolitics.1.d:0 "With our capture of the Sardinian capital of Turin we have effectively won the war. The Sardinian King and their government have capitulated and a conference will be organised shortly to decide on the future of Sardinia-Piedmont. We are now presented with two options: signing a white peace with Sardinia-Piedmont and respecting the status quo or dividing the Kingdom of Sardinia into two halves with the mainland (Savoy) becoming a client state and the House of Savoy being exiled to Sardinia.\nThe first option will aleviate the fears of the other Great Powers of Europe in our upsetting of the balance of powers and it will also convince many Italians that our plans for Italy are not necessarily evil, but on the other hand it poses the risk that Sardinia-Piedmont once again tries to capture Milan and attempt to form 'Italy'.\nShould we divide the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont into two we will gain control of Piedmont, an important industrial region as well as effectively destroy any nationalist movements within it, we will however suffer the price of infamy and the Italian people will become very unruly."

The new state will be named the 'Kingdom of Savoy' and will be ruled by a dynasty loyal to us but also relatable to the Italian people. Two options are presented to us for the regnal position: Louis Lucien Bonaparte and Carlo Ludovico di Bourbon Parma.\nLouis Lucien Bonaparte is a scion of the Bonaparte familly, the third son of Napoleon Bonaparte's second brother. He is a rather uninspiring man but he can be easily manipulated by Austria and speaks fluently Italian. In addition to that his crowning will certainly improve our relationship with [FRA.GetNameDEF].\nCarlo Ludovico di Bourbon Parma, also known as Charles II of Parma, is the former Duke of Parma who had to abdicate in favour of his son in 1849 due to the pressure from the liberals in the Duchy. Ever since then he has been wandering Europe but he would certainly not disaprove of assuming a title much more significant than his former one. Carlo is however more of a liberal and even though he may assuage the Italians he may not always follow our course of action."

The Kingdom has however been a site of often violent insurrections by Italian nationalists again the Habsburg rule and with our close victory against Piedmont the time has come to decide on how we should deal with the Kingdom. A prominent idea put forward by the Conservatives is to annex Venice into the Austrian Empire, effectively recreating the Duchy of Lombardy. A popular option amongst the more Moderates is to keep the same structure for the Kingdom while the Liberals propose to give it more autonomy, in order to satisfy the Italians."

The Duchy of Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany have been ruled by the Habsburgs while the Duchy of Parma has been ruled by a Bourbon, which has effectively made these three states our client states due to our ideological and military support to them. With the war now over, we can finally see what we should do with the three states. Conservatives propose we keep the status quo, which would make them susceptible to nationalist infiltrations. Liberals on the other hand propose that we create a loose confederation named the "Italian League" to convince the Italians that the Habsburgs have only good plans for Italy."

Now that Piedmont is firmly under our rule, we can opt to cede them to France.

The agreement known as the 'Franco-Austrian Agreement on Savoy of [GetYear]' was signed between Interior Minister [AUS.GetLeader] of Austria and [FRA.GetLeader] of France. With this glorious agreement the Austrians showed that not only they can be trusted, but in fact they can be good friends of ours.

With Austria defeating Piedmont and then imposing a puppet state over it, they decided to cede Savoy and Nice to Napoleonic France. While this is a minor event on its own, it might suggest a rapprochement between Austria and Franch who after all share the same ideological values and are both hostile against Prussia.

 # Austrian Leader Descriptions #
 ################################
 
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BACH_DESC:0 "Baron Alexander von Bach serves as the Interior Minister of the Habsburg Monarchy and is the de facto leader of Austria in the matters of internal politics. The Baron comes from a family with a long history in the matter of law, and he himself is a Doctor of Laws and a loyal servant of the Empire. Ever since he took power, in 1849 during the Revolution, he has sought to depart from Metternich's overcontrolling system but at the same time has kept much of Metternich's principles in practice in his Klerikalabsolutist form of governance. The Baron favours centralising the Empire, with Vienna as the center of everything, and to maintain loyalty to the Emperor through a rigorous use of the secret police. The Baron is also, like most Conservative members of the Government, a supporter of the Catholic Church within Austria. Even though he enjoys he the support of the Emperor and of most German-Austrians, the Baron's policies have deeply dissatisfied the other ethnic groups in the Empire, and perhaps in due time it will be revealed his policies might have done more harm than good when it comes to the loyalty of Franz Joseph's subjects..."
 ANTON_VON_SCHMERLING_DESC:0 "Anton Ritter von Schmerling is the first Liberal Interior Minister of the Austrian Empire since the Congress of Vienna. Born in Vienna he studied law and for over twenty years served as a public servant in Lower Austria. He rose to prominence during the Revolutions of 1848 when he became President of the Confederate Diet. He supported the Government of Archduke John and quelled the revolt that broke out in Frankfurt.He returned to Vienna with the collapse of the Revolutions and became Minister of Justice until his resignation in 1851. Anton von Schmerling is a Liberal and a Centralist: he belives Austria should become a fully unitary state with a parliamentary government. While his ideas are seen with suspicion from the nobility and the Conservatives, he is seen as a man who might be able to unite the different ethnic groups under German power. The Emperor has put a lot of trust in him, and it remains to be seen what von Schmerling can accomplish."
 AGENOR_GOLUCHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Count Agenor Romuald Gołuchowski was appointed to replace Baron Alexander von Bach as Interior Minister. He is a Conservative and an aristocrat from Galicia and a close advisor to the Emperor, furthermore he has had a successful tenure as Governor of Galicia where he did several projects benefitting the poor region. The Count will oversee the creation of a Constitution liberal enough to satisfy the populace. Nonetheless, he might not be charismatic enough to reconcile all the different ethnic groups within the Empire..."
 ARCHDUKE_RAINIER_DESC:0 "Archduke Rainier Ferdinand of Austria is one of the several senior members of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Archduke studied law in Vienna and as most male members of the Monarchy he joined the Imperial Army. He married his cousine Archduchess Marie Karoline of Austria in 1852, which was to prove a very happy marriage. The Archduke was only mildly interested in politics, but he was seen as a perfect person to continue absolutism in the Empire by the court and so was appointed as Interior Minister by Franz Joseph. The Archduke is perhaps what the Empire needs, a pragmatic leader, though like the Emperor, perhaps slightly inert. Most of the actual power falls within the Absolutist faction within the court, and it is their job to ensure all men and women in the Empire are loyal subjects to His Majesty."
 RICHARD_VON_BELCREDI_DESC:0 "Count Richard von Belcredi was appointed to replace Anton von Schmerling as the Interior Minister. The Count stems from Margraviate of Moravia, though his familly descends from Lombardy, and studied law in Prague and then Vienna. Already a member of the Landtag since 1861, he is a seasoned bureaucrat and an opponent to the so called 'Compromise' with the Hungarians. The Count instead supports that the Empire becomes federalised, though in a conservative way where the local nobles retain essentially all power, in order to combat the various separatist movements. It is ultimately up to the Emperor whether Count von Belcredi will stay for long as Interior Minister, or he will be replaced with a more accomodating politician, as Anton von Schmerling was."
 FRIEDRICH_FERDINAND_VON_BEUST_DESC:0 "Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust is an odd choice for Minister-President, he is both a Saxon and a Protestant. Despite this, he is a clear opponent of Prussia, which so gravely offended us, as well as a very competent statesman. It is hope the Count will bring to an end the negotiations with the Magyars and restore faith to the Monarchy. It is time that misfortune ends and a new period of peace and stability is ushered..."
