prussia.9.t:0 "Ceremonial Change of Name"
prussia.9.d:0 "After successfully finishing Hagen's port expansion plan at the Jade Bight, the emerging city has been renamed to 'Wilhelmshaven' in today's ceremony at the site. Although still a rather modest townlet, Hagen's plan leaves room for much larger construction works in the future."

prussia.10.t:0 "Prussia requests military access!"
prussia.10.d:0 "The Prussians have requested military access through our lands - they claim they need our roads as supply routes to supply their troops in the Rhine Area. The question now is - do we want to support this ordeal?"
prussia.10.a:0 "Sure, there is no issue with it."
prussia.10.b:0 "Why would we just give them access?"

prussia.12.t:0 "Hannover denies our request!"
prussia.12.d:0 "Hannover denied our request for military access - it looks like the supply routes through their lands will remain out of our grasp for some time. Shall we just accept this or take this as an insult to Prussian Authority?"

prussia.12.b:0 "They will pay for that!"
prussia.13.t:0 "The End of Neuchatel Crisis"
prussia.13.d:0 "Our relationship with the Principality of Neuchatel has been...strained, over the previous century. We came to own it in 1707, and, over the next century, it switched hands between us and the French twice. In 1815, Frederick William III of Prussia decided to allow the small Principality to join the Swiss Confederation while still remaining under our effective control. Yet, in 1848, those ungrateful dogs revolted against our rule! Since then, we have been pressing our claim to the region. We finally thought the Swiss might concede, as Neuchatel monarchists loyal to the Prince revolted, but, with the support of the British, they rebutted our claim. We are forced to allow the independence of this small province."
prussia.13.a:0 "This shame upon the honor of the Kingdom of Prussia shall not be forgotten."
prussia.14.t:0 "Scheibert comes back!"
prussia.14.d:0 "We sent captain Justus Scheibert as an observer to America, in order to observe American Civil War and learn new valuable tactics, however, the war took shorter than we expected and Scheibert was forced to come back."

prussia.15.a:0 "A valuable lesson"
prussia.16.t:0 "Idstedt Lion"
prussia.16.d:0 "A few years ago, the Danes built a statue of lion in Flensburg, commemorating their victory over German forces in the First Schleswig War. Now that we control Flensburg, perhaps it's time to get rid of this symbol of a German defeat?"
prussia.16.a:0 "Dismantle the statue"
prussia.16.b:0 "Let the statue be"
prussia.17.t:0 "Heydt's Rescript"
prussia.17.d:0 "Recently, doctor Robert Avé-Lallemant came back from his journeys in Brazil. While this in itself is quite positive news, the news he bears aren't that good. Germans who decided to emigrate to Brazil are being exploited by fazendeiros, all-powerful owners of coffee plantations. They lack food, medical care, and due to nature of the system they were tricked into, they constatnly fall deeper and deeper into debts. As Avé-Lallemant put it, it is a human butchery. We must act, therefore we shall disallow any emigration for recruitment to Brazil"
prussia.17.a:0 "It is the only reasonable choice"
prussia.18.t:0 "DEBUG: Hidden Event; Prussia; id #18"

prussia.21.d:0 "Today, workers of Siemens-Halske company finished construction of telegraph line between our capital and city of Athens"
prussia.21.a:0 "Excellent!"
prussia.22.t:0 "The Regency of Prince Wilhelm"
prussia.22.d:0 "Due to the poor health of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, his brother and successor, Prince Wilhelm I, has been declared regent in the [PRS.GetName] for now. Since the king's health is unlikely to improve, this arrangement is looking to become permanent."
prussia.22.a:0 "At least it will stabilize the situation a bit..."
prussia.23.t:0 "The Coronation of Wilhelm I"
prussia.23.d:0 "Following the mourning of the death of Friedrich Wilhelm IV, our country now needs to look forward and carry on with the succession by coronating a new king. This has happened earlier today, when Wilhelm I was officially coronated in Königsberg!"
prussia.23.a:0 "Three Hoorays!"
prussia.24.t:0 "The Prussian Postal Service"
prussia.24.d:0 "The Prussian Postal Service has been in operation since 1806, but only as recently as 1850 has Prussia gotten its own Postal Stamps. Now, with the recent administrative reforms and expansion of the system, it is working better than ever."
prussia.24.a:0 "Good."
prussia.25.t:0 "50th Anniversary Ceremony of the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig"
prussia.25.d:0 "It's been 50 years since the combined armies of Russia, Sweden and many German countries handed Napoléon Bonaparte a decisive defeat south of Leipzig, in a battle that was the largest Europe has ever seen. Not only was the so-called 'Battle of the Nations' a major milestone in Napoléon's demise, it also fueled hopes of a German nation state and, for the first time, made this distant dream seem like a real possibility."
prussia.25.a:0 "Let's commemorate and remember the fallen soldiers."
prussia.26.t:0 "Excavations in Wolin"
prussia.26.d:0 "Rudolf Virchow, an archaeologist from Berlin, has recently begun with the excavation and study of the history of the ancient slavic/viking city of Wolin, which is situated north of Stettin. This may teach us more about our Prussian heritage..."
prussia.26.a:0 "Fascinating."
prussia.27.t:0 "City Rights for Kattowitz"
prussia.27.d:0 "After a long existence, Kattowitz, one of the biggest cities in Silesia, has finally achieved full city rights! This will make many administrative tasks in the region much easier..."
prussia.27.a:0 "Finally..."
prussia.28.t:0 "Prussia Invites Us to Trade with the Zollverein"
prussia.28.d:0 "[PRS.GetNameDef] has invited our nation to trade with the Zollverein, in a bid to increase mutual benefit and influence. Should we accept?"
prussia.28.a:0 "Yes, let trade with them."
prussia.28.b:0 "No, we shouldn't trade with them."
prussia.29.t:0 "State Names: English or German?"
prussia.29.d:0 "This mod gives you the option of playing with the German names for the states in the Germany region. Do you want to enable this?"
prussia.29.a:0 "Yes, I want the German names."
prussia.29.b:0 "No, keep it in English."
PRS_event_german_rename_effect_tt:0 "The §Ystates§! in the §YGermany§! region will be renamed to their §YGerman§! names."
prussia.30.t:0 "[PRS.GetAdjective] Reserves Mobilizing"
prussia.30.d:0 "Prussia has, throughout history, established a system where the military has a strong, well trained force of reservists to fall back on in wartime. Since we are now at war, it is time for our reserves to mobilize!"
prussia.30.a:0 "This will help the war effort."
prussia.31.t:0 "[PRS.GetAdjective] Reserves Demobilizing"
prussia.31.d:0 "The war is over, and the men and support we have drawn from the reserve system are no longer needed."
prussia.31.a:0 "Back to the reserves you go!"
prussia.32.t:0 "Rudolf Virchow - the Father of Cellular Pathology"
prussia.32.d:0 "Earlier this year, Dr. Rudolf Ludwig Carl Virchow published his book, "Zelluläre Pathologie", or Cellular Pathology. A renowned author and scientist, previously accredited for being the Father of Pathology, his studies have yielded ground-breaking discoveries. The names of many diseases, such as leukemia, chordoma, ochronosis, embolism, and thrombosis, have been coined by him. His studies on pathology, the causes, and effects of disease or injury have been used recently in many hospitals, including the Charité Hospital, the largest in the [PRS.GetName]. His most recent book was endorsed by many medical schools and hospitals emulating his studies. Perhaps a celebration for his works is in order! Our regent Wilhelm I will most assuredly have some words of praise in store for his findings."
prussia.32.a:0 "An interesting read."
prussia.33.t:0 "The Adventures of Wilhelm Stieber:\nSpying on Subversives"
prussia.33.d:0 "Wilhelm Stieber, head of the recently established Central-Nachrichten-Bureau, the Prussian secret service, has quite the history of intelligence activity. After the March Revolution of 1848/49, he established secret communication lines with the Prussian foreign ministry, passing information regarding Karl Marx and his revolutionaries. According to the information gathered, Stieber disguised himself as a doctor and infiltrated Marx’s London home to uncover valuable intel on the identities of Marxist followers across Europe. His letters state that he left for Marx's place at 64 Dean Street early in the day and stayed until noon. He would then go to relay the information to the embassy in Paris and many of the German Minors. Although his involvement in the ensuing trials would be less than laudable, his documents led to the arrest of many revolutionaries across Europe and dealt a devastating blow to the Communist League, a secret society of communists and Marxists, which was forcefully dissolved in 1852."
prussia.33.a:0 "Großartig!"
prussia.34.t:0 "The Adventures of Wilhelm Stieber:\nScientific Rectification"
prussia.34.d:0 "Director Stieber also led the mission during one of the winters of the early 1850s, when a Greek swindler by the name of Constantine Simonides obtained a large sum of money from the Berlin Academy of Science for a fake Ancient Greek manuscript. The academy is funded directly by the king's treasury, so, unable to bear the humiliation of being deluded, Stieber was ordered by the king himself to return the money and capture the scoundrel. Stieber quickly tracked Simonides down and, using an elderly circus performer as his German interpreter, threatened Simonides to return the money or be handed over to the notoriously brutal Greek police. Having secured the recompense, Stieber escorted Simonides to the border and ordered him never to enter the [PRS.GetName] again. King Friedrich Wilhelm IV subsequently showed his gratitude for restoring the Hohenzollern academy's dignity and granted him a sizeable reward."
prussia.34.a:0 "Gute Arbeit!"
prussia.35.t:0 "The Adventures of Wilhelm Stieber:\nGang Crasher"
prussia.35.d:0 "Now titled [PRS.GetLeader]'s master spy, Stieber seems to enjoy immersing himself in uncovering gang crimes across the [PRS.GetName]. One of his most notable missions involved investigating a counterfeiting gang who were undermining Prussian efforts to standardize the currency across the Zollverein. Having tracked them to the northern areas of Westphalia, he found the gangs underground and observed their behavior. During a large gathering, he led a team of Prussian Secret Police, or the Preußische Geheimpolizei, to surround and detain them. He also headed the investigation against Prussian insider trading. Several individuals were involved in a gang that illegally obtained stocks on the Berlin stock exchange using methods of insider trading. Stieber used his network in the prostitution business to gather information and testimonies that led to the arrest of these frauds. From then on, insider trading was no more in the [PRS.GetName]."
prussia.35.a:0 "Hervorragend!"
prussia.36.t:0 "DEBUG: Hidden Event; Prussia; id #36"
prussia.36.d:0 "Hidden Event that makes Denmark revoke access to Prussia."
prussia.36.a:0 "Okay."
prussia.37.t:0 "Lessons from the Austro-Sardinian War"
prussia.37.d:0 "Both, the Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence have proven the deficiencies of our army quite plainly. We need to think of possible reform measures."
prussia.37.a:0 "An's Werk!"
prussia.38.t:0 "Deutscher Nationalverein"
prussia.38.d:0 "The violent aggravation of the Italian struggle for unification sent shockwaves across the continent. Especially in fragmented Germany, the ideals of the nation-state fell on very fertile ground. One of the main proponents of a united German nation was founded in the immediate aftermath of the Austro-Sardinian War - the German National Association or 'Deutscher Nationalverein.' Formed by liberals and moderate democrats, the association supported a Prussian-led German nation-state without Austria."
prussia.38.a:0 "Von der Maas bis an die Memel, von der Etsch bis an den Belt..."
prussia.39.t:0 "Proclamation of a united Italy"
prussia.39.d:0 "The proclamation of an Italian nation-state greatly influenced the German public. A growing number of people, especially among the bourgeois middle class, wholeheartedly supported the idea of a German national state. If the Italians were able to do it, why shouldn't the Germans, too?"
prussia.39.a:0 "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles..."
prussia.40.t:0 "Preußischer Volksverein"
prussia.40.d:0 "The proclamation of Italy and its subsequent recognition by Prussia once again inspired the German national movement, this time especially among the conservative clientele in the Prussian countryside. The foundation of the antiliberal, conservative Prussian People's Association or 'Preußischer Volksverein' served the purpose of bringing about a Prussian-led united Germany - by force of arms, if need be..."
prussia.40.a:0 "Über alles in der Welt!"
prussia.41.t:0 "Deutscher Reformverein"
prussia.41.d:0 "The increasing political heft of the national movement that supported a Prussian-led Germany without Austria scared a number of people, especially in the Catholic parts of western and southern Germany. Their reaction was the foundation of the Prussian 'Reformverein' that supported a reform of the German Confederation and the integration of Austria. It had little political impact, though."
prussia.41.a:0 "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"
prussia.42.t:0 "The New Era Cabinet - Karl Anton von Hohenzollern new PM"
prussia.42.d:0 "With the regency of Crown Prince Wilhelm comes an unexpected wave of liberalism in Prussia. The crown prince, who had hitherto been seen as a reactionary by many in Prussia, has spent some time at the court of Queen Victoria in liberal Great Britain after being forced to flee from Berlin amidst the March Revolution of 1848/49. The cabinet he installed after acceding regency, headed by Prime Minister Karl Anton von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, sparks hope of a liberal wind of change."
prussia.42.a:0 "Wohlan!"
prussia.43.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV)"
prussia.43.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Supporters of the German workers' movement have gathered in Leipzig, Saxony, today to establish Germany's first labor party, the General German Workers' Association or 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV). Headed by a certain Ferdinand Lassalle, the party delegates predominantly support a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.43.a:0 "Mann der Arbeit, aufgewacht..."
prussia.44.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (VDAV)"
prussia.44.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. As a reaction to the foundation of the ADAV, supporters of a different approach within the German workers' movement have gathered in Frankfurt today to establish another labor party, the Congress of German Workers' Associations or 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeitervereine' (VDAV). Leopold Sonnemann, Max Hirsch and Eugen Richter are among the leaders of the new party, who - at the moment - predominantly supports a reformist socialist agenda, although the revolutionary wing is gaining power."
prussia.44.a:0 "...und erkenne deine Macht!"
prussia.45.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP)"
prussia.45.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Following differences primarily concerning the question of German nationalism, the VDAV was split and the majority of its supporters have gathered in Eisenach today to establish a successor labor party, the Social Democratic Workers' Party or 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP). August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht are among the leaders of the new party, who predominantly supports a Marxist socialist agenda."
prussia.45.a:0 "Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!"
prussia.46.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP)"
prussia.46.d:0 "The German unification made the most striking dispute between the different German labor parties obsolote. But the unity had been violently crafted under the aegis of the Prussian monarchy and military, thus, the German workers' movement awoke to the danger of being suppressed by conservative authorities. In order to strengthen their political weight, many of its supporters have gathered in Gotha today to establish a united labor party, the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany or 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP), predominantly supporting a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.46.a:0 "These socialists are becoming more and more dangerous..."
prussia.47.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD)"
prussia.47.d:0 "The Bismarckian Anti-Socialist Laws have proven that the worst fears of the German workers' movement were not unfounded. But Bismarck and the laws are a thing of the past now. The vast majority of the supporters of socialism in Germany have gathered in Erfurt today to establish a newly united labor party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany or 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD), supporting a reformist socialist agenda, at least for now..."
prussia.47.a:0 "We will have to watch them very closely."
prussia.48.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP)"
prussia.48.d:0 "Negotiations for a North German constitution have recently started, but not everyone in Prussia is happy with the developments that will most likely result in a compromise to integrate the other states in northern Germany. The conservatives are estranged over the dispute of preserving a Prussian spirit and progress towards German unity. As a result, the party members that support our plans for unity have separated themselves from the traditional conservatives. We can bank on the support of the Free Conservative Party, or 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP), for our future proposals."
prussia.48.a:0 "Sehr gut!"
prussia.49.t:0 "Rising Support for Political Catholicism - 'Fraktion des Zentrums'"
prussia.49.d:0 "Although we strive for denominational equality, our Catholic subjects fear future oppression. That's why they are starting to tie their political behavior to their belief. Catholic delegates in parliament have taken the first step to the establishment of a political party. They now stand united as the so-called faction of the centre, or 'Fraktion des Zentrums.'"
prussia.49.a:0 "We need to watch the Catholics."
prussia.50.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Zentrumspartei'"
prussia.50.d:0 "So-called political Catholicism is no longer an intellectual subject only. Catholics from around the country have gathered to establish an all-Catholic political party that aims to represent the interests of all Catholics within our borders. Their leader seems to be a certain Ludwig Windthorst from the former Kingdom of Hanover."
prussia.50.a:0 "A Guelph and Catholic? We need to watch them even more closely."
prussia.51.t:0 "Alfred Krupp - Social Benefactor? - Health Insurance (1/5)"
prussia.51.d:0 "Since 1836, Alfred Krupp has been offering his long-term employees a voluntary health insurance, paid in half by the employee and the employer respectively. In the beginning, the employer's share had largely been financed through fines that workers had to pay for rule violation, but soon the number of people in the insurance grew and Krupp readily upheld his part of the bargain. In 1855, the employee health insurance became mandatory and Krupp's workers' insurance scheme is rapidly growing to be by far the largest program of its kind in the nation."
prussia.51.a:0 "Gute Besserung!"
prussia.52.t:0 "Alfred Krupp - Social Benefactor? - Pensions and Accidents (2/5)"
prussia.52.d:0 "Established for a few years now, the staff pension fund has just been declared mandatory for all 'Kruppianer', meaning all employees of the Krupp company. Similar to the health insurance policy at Krupp, the workers will have to pay one half of the contributions, whilst the employer pays the other half. Workers that have been with the company for 15 years or more are entitled to a pension. In case of termination of employment, which Krupp tries hard to avoid even in times of economic struggle, all claims are forfeited.\n\nKrupp has also introduced an accident insurance for his workers that they don't need to contribute to at all. If a worker becomes permanently unfit for work due to a workplace accident, he will receive a pension irregardless of how long he's served the company. In case an employee died after more than 15 years of work before receiving a pension, the widow is also entitled to two thirds of her husband's pension claim."
prussia.52.a:0 "Junge, hier ist Helmpflicht!"
prussia.53.t:0 "Alfred Krupp - Social Benefactor? - Affordable Housing (3/5)"
prussia.53.d:0 "Started by his father Friedrich, Alfred Krupp has continued and expanded the company's efforts to provide affordable housing to its employees. The Krupp company continues to have a big influence not only on the economic development of Germany, but is also shaping the cityscape of Essen."
prussia.53.a:0 "So lässt sich's leben!"
prussia.54.t:0 "Alfred Krupp - Social Benefactor?  - Further Measures (4/5)"
prussia.54.d:0 "Next to affordable Housing, Krupp has also started to offer his employees the opportunity to do their grocery and necessity shopping at company-owned shops and stores, at slightly reduced and subsized prices. You have to pay in cash in these stores, though, and food stamps and the like are not accepted as payment. Furthermore, terminated employees lose their discount eligibility.\n\nThe Krupp company also operates a number of schools for the children of employees, a hospital and an outdoor swimming pool. Alfred Krupp has also been raising the wages significantly over the last decade and now pays considerably more than the average wage of industrial workers in Germany."
prussia.54.a:0 "Frohes Einkaufen!"
prussia.55.t:0 "Alfred Krupp - Social Benefactor? - The Flipside of Krupp's Benevolence (5/5)"
prussia.55.d:0 "Despite - or perhaps because of - his undoubted efforts to improve the social situation of his workers, Alfred Krupp also expects his employees to work and behave in a certain way that follows his personal beliefs. The labour standards are much stricter in Krupp factories than in most other German companies, and workers found guily of breaking the code are subject to severe, although only financial punishment. Krupp employees are generally forbidden to participate in labour strikes and political associations of the working class, like labour unions. Even reading a socialist newspaper can get you fired. After all, Krupp is a businessman and a wealthy industrialist who wants to keep his place and run his business in his way. He's willing to actively seek improvement for his long-term employees in return, though."
prussia.55.a:0 "Ein zweischneidiges Schwert..."

#Monuments
prussiamonuments.1.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Interior Complete"
prussiamonuments.1.d:0 "After more than 300 painful years of standstill at the construction site of the Cologne Cathedral, the final phase to complete the greatest church in Germany had been started under the late King Friedrich Wilhelm IV in 1842. Now, more than twenty years after the cornerstone ceremony of the continuation, the cathedral's nave and transept have been completed, which means that the interior is finally almost fully accessible."
prussiamonuments.1.a:0 "Only the Towers remain unfinished..."
prussiamonuments.2.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Forging of the Kaiserglocke"
prussiamonuments.2.d:0 "The towers of the Cologne Cathedral are slowly nearing completion. The construction process already allows for the installation of the primary bell. The king has ordered that the new bell should be forged from tin and bronze of captured gun barrels from the Franco-Prussian War, as a symbol of German victory and unity. After several forging attempts, the massive Kaiserglocke is finally ready to be installed in the southern tower of the cathedral."
prussiamonuments.2.a:0 "May it sound the bell for a prosperous future!"
prussiamonuments.3.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Towers Finished"
prussiamonuments.3.d:0 "A day to remember for all the citizens of Cologne, for all the people in Germany, and for all Catholics worldwide: the towers of the Cologne Cathedral have finally been finished. This great monument of Gothic architecture will not only inspire faith in all Christians, it also serves as a demonstration of the German art of engineering, with the roof framework being the largest structural steelwork on earth, at least for the time being."
prussiamonuments.3.a:0 "This is worthy of a great ceremony!"
prussiamonuments.4.t:0 "Cologne Cathedral - Inauguration Ceremony"
prussiamonuments.4.d:0 "After more than 632 years of construction, the Cologne Cathedral has finally been completed very recently. With a towering height of over 157 metres, it currently is the tallest building in the world - and possibly an allegory made of stone of Germany's great future?"
prussiamonuments.4.a:0 "Gott mit uns!"
prussiamonuments.5.t:0 "Plans for a Victory Monument in Berlin"
prussiamonuments.5.d_initial:0 "Immediately after news of our great victory in Denmark reached Berlin, there was speculation about a possible monument celebrating the liberation of Germans from Danish oppression. As we wholeheartedly support this initiative, a planning commission, led by the Prussian architect to the royal court, Heinrich Strack, was appointed to prepare possible drafts for such a landmark. Their initial proposals have just reached the government. It appears that a column is the preferred design of the responsible architects, and more detailed plans are expected to be drawn up over the next months and years."
prussiamonuments.5.d_final:0 "Our great victories of late are crying for a victory monument in Berlin. As we wholeheartedly support this initiative, a planning commission, led by the Prussian architect to the royal court, Heinrich Strack, was appointed to prepare possible drafts for such a landmark. Their initial proposals have just reached the government. It appears that a column is the preferred design of the responsible architects, and more detailed plans are expected to be drawn up over the next few months."
prussiamonuments.5.a:0 "Sounds good."
prussiamonuments.6.t:0 "Adaption of Plans for the Victory Monument in Berlin"
prussiamonuments.6.d:0 "Our latest victory over Austria made our initial draft for the victory monument in Berlin seem a little undersized... We needed to adapt and expand the proposed project to be more appropriate in terms of the significance of our victory. The planning commission from the Berliner Bauakademie was surely glad to adjust to our ambitions, and their latest proposal shows great foresight in leaving room for further enhancements."
prussiamonuments.6.a:0 "We need to think a bit bigger."
prussiamonuments.7.t:0 "Readaption of Plans for the Great Victory Monument in Berlin"

On its top at the height of over 50 metres, sits an 8.32 metre bronze sculpture depicting the Roman goddess of victory, Victoria, who wears a Prussian eagle helmet and, thus, resembles Borussia, the female personification of Prussia. In her right hand, she holds a laurel crown that represent the Prussian victories of the past, and in her left hand, she holds a battle standard featuring the Iron Cross, commemorating the accomplishments of the Prussian military."

Vincke has always been expressing heavy criticism and remains to see the project as an irrelevant waste of money, suggesting that the funds be redirected towards other projects. What should we do?"

prussiaadvisors.1.t:0 "Death of Ernst Moritz Arndt"
prussiaadvisors.1.d:0 "The beloved hero, Ernst Moritz Arndt, was well known across the German states as an active nationalist and unifier. In his earlier years, he was an fighting for the abolition of serfdom, a form of debt paid for by peasants with military service, and later against Napoleonic rule. His most famous piece of work would be his song, 'Des Deutschen Vaterland', promoting the idea of a greater German nation. He will be deeply missed among the common people, as he was an inspiration for them."

prussiaadvisors.2.d:0 "Known throughout the German States for his famous writings and later national ideals, Dahlmann also took part in the Napoleonic Wars against the French at the Battle of Aspern, which resulted in an Austrian Victory. In 1848, he was elected to the national assembly at Frankfurt with the objective of unifying the German States under a constitutional monarchy. Although his desired 1848 constitution for Germany failed, he would later be called the 'father of German nationality', and our people, especially those with nationalist ideals, will deeply miss him."

prussiaadvisors.3.t:0 "Death of Friedrich Julius Stahl"
prussiaadvisors.3.d:0 "Word has been received that Friedrich Julius Stahl has unexpectedly passed away during a medical procedure. A Christian convert, Stahl used his wide influence to undermine the Prussian Union of Churches and to increase the power of the Lutheran Church. He wanted the state to adopt religious principles, which did not bring the likes of Bismarck to his side. Despite his reputation, Stahl would not end up playing a major role in the crisis of 1848/49, he asserted his influence under King Friedrich Wilhelm IV in the aftermath, though. Although he will surely be missed by many, the pious in particular, the majority of the Prussian people will probably forget about him."

prussiaadvisors.4.t:0 "Death of Ferdinand Lassalle"
prussiaadvisors.4.d:0 "Reports are coming in that Ferdinand Lassalle has been confirmed dead. Being a devout socialist and pro-monarchist at the same time, Lassalle was an ideologically conflicting man. He maintained relations with both the arch-communist Karl Marx and the arch-monarchist Otto von Bismarck. Although some will claim that Lassalle was a communist, in the end, he was the same thing that Bismarck was: a nationalist at heart, willing to undertake any social ideology to achieve the goal of a united Germany. His untimely death will surely be a severe blow to moderate socialism in Germany, as the movement loses it's most brilliant thinker."

prussiaadvisors.5.t:0 "Death of Carl von Bodelschwingh"
prussiaadvisors.5.d:0 "A former parliament and government member, Carl von Bodelschwingh, has recently passed away. Besides his opposition against the 'fratricidal' war with Austria, he was a deeply religious man and a hardline conservative, but still desired a unified Germany all the same. He was a leading force behind the rail connections in the west that would be crucial for fast mobilization in times of war. His legacy, although strengthened by the many things he's done, was tarnished by his resignation over the power struggle with Austria. May he rest in peace."

prussiaadvisors.6.d:0 "August von der Heydt has recently been reported to have peacefully passed away at his home in Berlin. An economic genius under several administrations, he would become the mastermind behind Prussia's financial and administrative advantage over Austria. Under his oversight, the mining industry was thriving after he had gotten rid of the mining guild's special privileges. Hundreds of banks would thank him later, as without his removal of some of the Prussian banking restrictions, many of these wouldn't exist today."

prussiaadvisors.7.d:0 "Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach, an author and creator of the conservative newspaper 'Kreuzzeitung', has died in a traffic accident in Berlin earlier today. Being a staunch conservative, he opposed any form of conservative alliance with liberal nationalism throughout the 1860s and 70s even in the face of unification success. Although a protestant, he was deputy in the Reichstag for the Catholic Centre Party, and as such, voted against laws that were clearly discriminating against Catholics. Despite his great credentials, he shall remain little more than a footnote in the history of Germany."

prussiaadvisors.8.t:0 "Death of Moritz August von Bethmann Hollweg"
prussiaadvisors.8.d:0 "Moritz August von Bethmann Hollweg was a famous jurist and Prussian politician, who sadly passed away earlier today. Known mostly for his incredible influence on judicial reforms, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV elevated him to hereditary nobility shortly after the death of Friedrich Wilhelm III. Serving in both of Prussia's houses of parliament, he was an influential politician who caught the eyes of many. Much opposed to the democratizing tendencies of his time around Europe, he would co-found multiple organizations striving to preserve conservatism, including the 'Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag'. He will surely leave the conservative part of the country mourning him."

prussiaadvisors.9.d:0 "Friedrich von Wrangel, a true military legend, has passed away. A cavalry commander in his earlier days, he was loyal and ready to die in the service for his country. A staunch monarchist, during the March Revolution of 1848/49 he used emergency powers to overthrow the liberal president and put the kingdom before all else. He could be a controversial character, too, defying the king's orders to withdraw despite pressure from other European powers amidst the First Schleswig War, always believing in German unification until the end. His military honors shall be a list worth reading, and his name shall be written down in Prussian military history for centuries to come."

prussiaadvisors.10.d:0 "Today, on April 10 1878, renowned Prussian entrepreneur Albert Borsig has surprisingly passed away aged only 49. The Borsig family has been a very influential force in Prussia's economy, building one of the largest steam locomotive corporations on earth. Albert inherited his family's business after his father's death in 1854 and subsequently expanded operations to a global scale, whilst at the same time caring for the poor. A project remains even after his death, the Borsig Palace at the corner of the Wilhelmstraße in the heart of Berlin, which he had planned as a representative family residence, but sadly will not have the chance to see completed. Many will remember him as a famed entrepreneur and businessman, and the populace of Prussia mourns his death."

The late Eulenburg led our highly successful trade exhibition to Japan and China, resulting in favorable treaties with both nations. For his success, he was appointed to the Prussian government, where he would strive to improve our administrative capacity in the face of liberal and Catholic resistance. Without his efforts, the paperwork necessary to run the state would be miles high, and we may not have gotten this far without him, he will truly be missed."

prussiaadvisors.12.d:0 "Today, on January 29 1882, Prussia's newspapers are reporting the death of Wilhelm Stieber. Born in Merseburg to a noble government official for the Lutheran Ministry, he began studying German law at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin - against his father's wishes. He would later join the Berlin police force and, finding excitement there, quickly climbed the ranks until he was promoted by King Friedrich Wilhelm IV after the Revolution of 1848. Stieber would participate in many intelligence missions, including gathering intel on exiled political extremist Karl Marx. Alhough many despise his methods, his passing will be a loss for Prussia's secret service."

Although few would realize his true worth, von Itzenplitz held many jobs during his over twenty years of service as an advisor to the king and the agricultural ministry. Born into the landed gentry of Brandenburg-Prussia, he symbolized the determination and work ethic of the German people. A controversial railway administrator, his work for the government hasn't always been received without criticism and a fraud scandal, for which he was never found guilty, cost him some of his good reputation among the Prussian public. He died peacefully in his sleep and will be mourned by many, may he lay at rest."

prussiaadvisors.14.d:0 "The death of politician and economist Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch leaves the nation in consternation. Studying law at Leipzig and Halle, he went on to organize the world's first credit union and established Germany's first industrial cooperative. Later he also was a co-founder of the 'Deutsche Fortschrittspartei', always trying to support the common people against vicious capitalists. His early political career saw him seated in parliament from 1848-1851, but he left a far greater mark as an advocate of the workers' well-being, being the mastermind behind the passing of the Prussian law of association in 1867. Schulze-Delitzsch laid the groundwork for social welfare in Germany and will be deeply missed by an admiring public."

prussiaadvisors.16.d:0 "Unfortunate news reaches the capital today regarding the death of Alexander von Schleinitz. A fervid politician and ambassador, Schleinitz filled many roles in the royal administration during his lifetime. Originating from an aristocratic family from the Margraviate of Meissen and son of the Regierungspräsident of Blankenburg, Schleinitz often shifted between different positions in the ministry. As foreign executive, he negotiated peace with the Danish during the Second Schleswig War and ensured Prussia bolstered its power among the other European countries. He would remain politically active until the 1860s and became Minister of the Royal Household until his demise. Although he often quarreled with the government, he will surely be missed by conservative Prussians."

Born in Berlin, Duncker studied at the universities of Bonn and Berlin until 1834, where he and fellow students were accused of participating in then-restricted student societies, for which he had to serve a six month prison sentence. He would eventually graduate in 1842 and obtain a professorship for history at Halle University. His political career saw him be elected to both the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848 and later the Erfurt Assembly in 1850, and after that to the Prussian Abgeordnetenhaus. In 1867, he became director of the Prussian archives, tasked with incorporating those of Hanover, Hesse, and Nassau. A close friend to crown prince Friedrich Wilhelm, Duncker will be dearly missed, especially by German liberals."

prussiaadvisors.18.d:0 "This day will be remembered in all of Germany, but especially in its industrial heartland at the Ruhr, as famous metalworker and inventor, Alfred Krupp, has passed away. Krupp inherited a failing steel mill on the brink of bankruptcy from his father. Shortly after his father's death, Krupp re-opened the business with a new agenda. Trains were becoming an ever-more prominent means of travel across Europe, and Krupp seized this opportunity and made a fortune in the railroad construction industry. With his kind leadership, he was renowned for the excellent treatment of his workers, offering insurance and housing to the workers for their service. With thoughts on Prussian expansion, Krupp introduced the breech-loading cannon, engineered using cast steel howitzers, to the Prussian court. The king could not see a use and instead used it as a decorative ornament. However, the king's brother, Prince Wilhelm, thought differently.\n\nWhen Wilhelm became regent in 1859, Prussia purchased its first cannon from Krupp. This deal would eventually lead to Krupp becoming the largest arms producer in Germany, earning him the nickname 'Cannon King'. The Prussian people mourn the death of a brilliant mind and manufacturer, but fortunately, Alfred's son Friedrich promised to continue the business in the name of his father."

prussiaadvisors.19.d:0 "Mayor and cooperative pioneer Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen has passed away, shortly before his 70th birthday in Neuwied-Heddesdorf. Born in 1818 at Hamm, Rhineland, Raiffeisen would leave school at the age of 14, go on to receive three years of education from a local pastor before joining the military at 17. After contracting an eye disease, he was forced to resign in 1843 and soon found interest in public service. He went on to become mayor of a number of smaller towns across the Rhineland, when worsening health forced him to resign from his post in 1852. Retiring from his political career, Raiffeisen became a businessman and started a small cigar factory. Famous for his food banks across Prussia, he created the 'Verein für Selbstbeschaffung von Brot und Früchten' (Association for Self-Procurement of Bread and Fruits) during the winter starvation of 1846/47. The association's purpose was to stock food banks and send external profits to caritative usage. Influential in economics, Raiffeisen would further the idea of cooperative self-help during his time as mayor of Flammersfeld, eventually founding the first rural cooperative bank at Neuwied, from where he would go on to expand the business model across Prussia. A hero of the common people, the Prussian public deeply mourns his death."

Later, he was elected to Prussia's parliament, the Abgeordnetenhaus, as a member of the liberal faction, where he would set out to co-create the 'Deutsche Fortschrittspartei' (German Progress Party) in 1861, which became the first modern political party of Prussia. Forckenbeck took on many titles over the duration of his political career, such as President of the House of Representatives, President of the Reichstag Parliament, and Mayor of Breslau. In 1878, Forckenbeck was elected mayor of Berlin with an overwhelming majority, a position he would hold until his untimely demise.

Born into an old and influential family, Siemens intended to study in Berlin, however, his family was highly indebted and could not pay for the expensive school fees. He instead chose to join the Prussian Military Academy School of Artillery and Engineering, where he received his officer's training. A decorated soldier with various medals to his name and famous for his invention of the electrically-charged sea mine, his popularity grew among Prussian circles of power. Upon returning home from his war duties, Siemens chose to start his career in perfecting technologies, working with many famous minds of Europe during this time, the likes of engineer Elkington of Birmingham. Constructing from the ground up one of the largest manufacturing companies across Europe, his businesses continue to grow with the help of his sons who have split the company amongst themselves.

With his humorous and articulate writing, Freytag created, among other works, the Prussian comedic play 'The Journalist', which was an instant blockbuster among the German public. After moving permanently to Berlin, he worked closely with Julian Schmidt and founded 'Die Grenzboten', a weekly journal that became the heart of German and Austrian liberalism. His literary fame grew, even internationally, after the publication of 'Soll und Haben' (Debit and Credit). The novel was hailed for its expression of sturdy but unexaggerated realism with the intention of patriotic views for contrast between the homely vultures of the Germans and negative light on Poles and Jews.

Born into a wealthy family, his interests in law would take him to the universities of Giessen, Heidelberg, and Göttingen. During the infamous March Revolution of 1848, he would join the Republican uprising in the Palatinate and Baden. After order was restored by local authorities, Bamberger was sentenced to death but managed a last-minute escape to Switzerland with other revolutionaries on the run. Spending time in London, Holland, and Paris, he returned to Prussia after his sentence was lapsed and would climb to director of a minor banking company. A strong supporter of German unification, he got elected to the Reichstag a few years later, where he joined the National Liberal Party.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War, Bamberger was summoned by the Prussian delegation to help negotiate the terms of peace. Leading the German Reichstag on matters of finance and economics, he was the leading figure behind German currency politics and the formation of the Reichsbank. An advocate for free trade, he opposed conservative policies of protectionism and went on to co-found an association promoting free trade and competition. Bamberger established the foundations of modern banking and will always be remembered for his great achievements."

A pioneer of Marxist ideals in Germany and abroad, Liebknecht helped set the foundation for the modern German socialist parties. He studied at Giessen, Berlin, and Marburg, where he eventually graduated in philology, theology, and philosophy, hereby concerning himself the writings of St Simon, from which he gained a first interest in communism and its social structure. In late 1848, Liebknecht joined a poorly organized socialist legion in France aiming to instigate revolution in German but would be captured and charged with treason. On the eve of his trial, revolution erupted once more and a mob had him released.\n\nHe would flee to Switzerland and join a socialist league, but after a failed attempt at a workers revolution in Switzerland, and increased pressure from the Prussian government to hand him over, he would flee to London like so many other revolutionaries. During his time in London, Liebknecht joined the Communist League and became a close associate of revolutionary Karl Marx, ruining his remaining reputation with the Prussian government at the time. After returning to Germany, he became acquainted with August Bebel. The duo tried to foment anti-war sentiment after the Franco-Prussian War for which they were arrested and sentenced to two years in prison in one of the most spectacular trials Germany had ever seen. After his release, he was re-elected to the Reichstag in 1874 and Liebknecht would continue his work for socialism in Germany, even after his party had been outlawed. The Prussian elites might believe his death was good riddance, but his revolutionary ideas will live on."

A physician, anthropologist, writer, and politician, Virchow was a true jack-of-all-trades, considered by many to be the father of modern pathology and founder of social medicine, his colleagues would even reverently call him the 'Pope of medicine'. Virchow was born on October 13 1821, in the small town of Schivelbein, Pomerania. The only son of a farmer and representative in local government, he was a naughty child and poorly behaved at home. However, he was a brilliant student and passionate about science, languages, and driven by success.\n\nTaking unpaid assistant work at Charité Hospital, the largest in Berlin, his position allowed access to laboratories, which he used to study during his younger years. Later in his life, Virchow would strive to be a reformist for progress and modernity, coined for creating the phrase: ''Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale.'' Among many great discoveries and writings originating from his place of work, he is mainly credited for the fantastic piece of medical study called 'Zelluläre Pathologie' (Cellular Pathology). With many great advancements in the field of medicine and physics, both the scientific community and the Prussian people in general grieve over his passing."

Hobrecht would pass his examination in 1845 and continued his studies at the Berliner Bauakademie, the famous technical academy, joining a loose group of students interested in furthering the architectural development of Prussia. His largest project undoubtedly was the so-called Hobrecht-Plan, which he drafted to modernize Berlin's urban infrastructure, streamline the city's future development and establish sanitary standards in the capital. From there, Hobrecht would go on to engineer and modernize city infrastructures across the globe, in cities as prominent as Moscow, Tokyo, and Cairo. After returning to Berlin, he was commissioned by his brother, Arthur Hobrecht, Mayor of Berlin, to build a sewerage system spanning hundreds of square kilometers.

The mark he left in German politics as one of the earliest and most ardent socialists in the Reichstag is hard to understate. He was a patriot that never voted with the patriots, an atheist who advocated for secularism, and a man who spoke up for those who had no voice.

#Economy - HISTORICAL (mainly)
PRS_focus_economy:0 "The Prussian Economy"
PRS_focus_economy_desc:0 "For long the Prussian economy has prospered under its own conditions, but we are falling behind in adapting our economy to the trends of industrialization. A state that lags behind in economics lags behind in superiority; this we must recognize."
PRS_focus_state_rail:0 "Preußische Staatseisenbahnen"
PRS_focus_state_rail_desc:0 "We will subsidize the construction of new railway networks across our country - our infrastructure will certainly benefit from this."
PRS_focus_berlin_anhalt_rail:0 "Expand Berlin-Anhalt Railway"
PRS_focus_berlin_anhalt_rail_desc:0 "The Berlin-Anhaltische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft had rapidly expanded the network of railways within our nation. Originally spanning for a mere 20 kilometers, the Berlin-Anhalt railway project has since connected many places with Berlin, and linked with many other railway lines. Connecting the lines from Wittenberg to Bitterfeld will greatly increase the span of the BAE."
PRS_focus_silesia_rail:0 "Expand Silesian Railways"
PRS_focus_silesia_rail_desc:0 "Expanding the current railway network in Silesia will expand our reach to the provinces of southeastern Prussia, which could be vital should we have to confront Austria one day..."
PRS_focus_ostbahn_rail:0 "Finish Preußische Ostbahn"
PRS_focus_ostbahn_rail_desc:0 "We shall finish the grand railway line expanding infrastructure in the east of our country, and thus, finally connecting our capital, Berlin, with the traditional city of the monarch's coronation, Königsberg."
PRS_focus_rhineland_rail:0 "Expand Rhineland Railways"
PRS_focus_rhineland_rail_desc:0 "Expanding the current railway system in the Rhineland and Westphalia will support economic growth, and allow resources to move more swiftly in the western provinces."
PRS_focus_trade_and_commerce:0 "Trade & Commerce"

PRS_focus_norswe_zoll:0 "Zollverein Foreign Trade Treaties"
PRS_focus_norswe_zoll_desc:0 "Originally the Zollverein was a customs union intended to connect the German states, remove custom barriers and manage economic policies within its territory. Despite having differences in culture and history, several countries are interested in trading with the Zollverein, and after much discussion it has been agreed that such treaties would ultimately benefit all member states."
PRS_focus_trade_france:0 "Trade Treaty with France"
PRS_focus_trade_france_desc:0 "No matter how we stand with the French, their country is rich, and we could certainly benefit from expanding trade between our nations."
PRS_focus_berliner_borse:0 "Berliner Börse"
PRS_focus_berliner_borse_desc:0 "The Berlin stock exchange is slowly growing in importance. The old venue, however, offers little to no room for expansion. We should find a site for a new building that will represent the rise in esteem of Prussian finance and commerce."
PRS_focus_prussian_consortium:0 "Preußen-Konsortium"
PRS_focus_prussian_consortium_desc:0 "By forming a consortium of the most powerful banks of Prussia, we could dramatically increase the value and security of our state bonds, which, in turn, would give us financial leeway for both domestic and international projects."
PRS_focus_economic_legislation:0 "Economic Legislation"
PRS_focus_economic_legislation_desc:0 "Prussian economic legislation has only just begun to coordinate the practices of trade, commerce, science and industry more rigorously. By expanding, standardizing and centralizing these regulations, we could certainly remove obstacles and prevent exploitation."
PRS_focus_handelsgesetz_law:0 "Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch"
PRS_focus_handelsgesetz_law_desc:0 "While our trade networks and maritime influence is miniscule compared to the colonial powers of the west, the German regions have been structured through centuries of mercantile trade even far before the Hansa. Until now, the exact state of merchants and trade was only vaguely defined or discussed within the government, and with the rise of capitalism and industrialization, our nation now needs to tackle this. The lack of a centralized trade also resembles the disunity of the German states; as the dominant German power, Prussia needs to push ahead. Reforming the drafts suggested in the Paulskirche Constitution should solidify our trade, and unite the German Confederation closer than before."
PRS_focus_borsenordnung:0 "Neue Börsenordnung"
PRS_focus_borsenordnung_desc:0 "With the growth of the equity market comes the necessity for regulation. To prevent economic disruption and to further stimulate growth and stability, we will need to regulate the stock exchanges in Prussia."
PRS_focus_protect_patentordnung:0 "Protect the Patentordnung"
PRS_focus_protect_patentordnung_desc:0 "For far too long, the lack of a copyright law has hindered scientific and cultural advance. Now, advocates of radical free trade are beginning to gather support for an abolition of the Patentordnung, which protects intellectual property concerning inventions. They claim that such legislation hinders economic growth because it prevents inventions from spreading. However, it has been proven in the UK and the US that a patent law actually encourages ingenuity; hence, we must not give in to their demands."
PRS_focus_mining_standards:0 "Preußisches Berggesetz"
PRS_focus_mining_standards_desc:0 "Mining has been a strong factor of German industry and trade even before medieval times, but with the Industrial Era on our doorstep, we need to improve our mining standards. Germany is full of important resources like coal and iron, but the lack of proper standards is hindering our development."
PRS_focus_prussian_urbanization:0 "Prussian Urbanization"
PRS_focus_prussian_urbanization_desc:0 "Although the majority of the Prussian population still lives in the countryside, the percentage of people living in cities is growing rapidly. This process, commonly referred to as urbanization, goes hand in hand with the industrial development of our country, and encouraging it would probably be beneficial."
PRS_focus_execute_hobrecht_plan:0 "Execute Hobrecht Plan"
PRS_focus_execute_hobrecht_plan_desc:0 "Our capital, Berlin, is growing fast. People from the sorrounding countryside and from all over our realm are moving into the city to find work, a better life, or the thrill of living in one of the most dynamic cities of its time. But thousands of incomers naturally cause problems. Luckily for us, we have an expert in urban planning, by the name of James Hobrecht, amongst the city's administrative body."
PRS_focus_execute_hobrecht_plan_effect_tt:0 "§GJames Hobrecht can be selected as an advisor.§!"
PRS_focus_encourage_ruhr_urbanization:0 "Encourage Ruhr Urbanization"
PRS_focus_encourage_ruhr_urbanization_desc:0 "Half a century ago rather desolate regions of Germany, the Rhineland and Westphalia were given to Prussia as a consolation prize at the Congress of Vienna of 1815. For a couple of decades now, they have been turning into properous and industrialized centers of Prussia. Especially cities close to the Ruhr river, like Duisburg, Dortmund, or Essen, built on large deposits of coal and other minerals, are growing rapidly. We should try to encourage and channel this internal migration to our benefit."
PRS_focus_encourage_silesian_urbanization:0 "Encourage Silesian Urbanization"
PRS_focus_encourage_silesian_urbanization_desc:0 "Silesia is another industrial heartland of Prussia. Urban centers along the Oder river valley like Breslau, as well as emerging mining districts in the resource-rich hills of Upper Silesia like Kattowitz are contributing to the industrial development of Prussia, a process that we should try to encourage."
PRS_focus_establish_sewerage_standards:0 "Establish Sewerage Standards"
PRS_focus_establish_sewerage_standards_desc:0 "If we want to prevent epidemics and avoid our growing urban centers from turning into sanitary hellholes, we need to establish sewerage standards. Our city planner James Hobrecht has quite some expertise in this area and we should try to capitalize on this."
PRS_focus_prussian_industrialization:0 "Prussian Industrialization"
PRS_focus_prussian_industrialization_desc:0 "While the industrial revolution has come to our nation, most of our economy is still being dominated by pre-industrial business sectors, like agriculture or handcraft. Promoting the industrial development of urban regions will surely support economic growth."
PRS_focus_borsig:0 "Borsig"
PRS_focus_borsig_desc:0 "August Borsig has been in the business of mechanical engineering since 1837, his company now focuses on locomotives. He has recently expanded his factories in the northwest of Berlin, and supporting him in his efforts could help to secure a dominant and stable supplier of much-needed railway equipment."
PRS_focus_krupp_cooperation:0 "Krupp"
PRS_focus_krupp_cooperation_desc:0 "The uneasy balance between state and corporate has proved superiority for the companies, as both their capital and devotion to production is far greater than we will ever be able to achieve on our own. One of the most prominent of these entrepreneurs, Friedrich Krupp, specializes in the production of steel and artillery, and cooperating with him will surely not only increase our militaristic capacities, but also reduce our burden in times of war."
PRS_focus_siemens_halske:0 "Siemens & Halske"
PRS_focus_siemens_halske_desc:0 "Werner Siemens is one of the most innovative minds in the field of telecommunications worldwide. In 1847, he established his business with the precision engineer Johann Georg Halske in the west of Berlin. Since then, the company has experienced dramatic growth, and we could certainly benefit from supporting them in their efforts."
PRS_focus_vulcan_ag:0 "Vulcan AG"
PRS_focus_vulcan_ag_desc:0 "Pomerania, along with the provinces of Berlin and Brandenburg around it, stands as an example of great industrial might within Central Europe, but when compared to the world leaders of industrialization, it still has quite a way to go. One promising company from Stettin is the so-called Vulcan AG, specialized in the ship-building industry. Expanding their factories and subsidising industrial growth in the region should increase our industrial capability greatly."
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle:0 "Dreyse Rifle"
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_desc:0 "Originally developed by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse in his manufacture in the Thuringian hinterland, the Dreyse needle gun is a promising bolt action breechloading rifle. If we can manage to mass-produce this technologically superior rifle, we should enjoy a significant advantage on the battlefield."
PRS_focus_spandau_arsenal:0 "Move the Royal Arsenal to Spandau"
PRS_focus_spandau_arsenal_desc:0 "Originally situated in Potsdam, the Königliche Preußische Gewehrfabrique has been the prime supplier for Prussian arms for quite some time now. The factory grounds in Potsdam have reached their capacity though, and the arsenal and its associated factories are currently moving to Spandau, on the eastern outskirts of Berlin, to allow room for expansion. We will have to complete the move of the Royal Arsenal to the Spandau Citadel in Berlin, so we can increase its military production in the future."
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_factory:0 "Dreyse Gewehrfabrik"
PRS_focus_dreyse_rifle_factory_desc:0 "In order to mass-produce the Dreyse rifle, we will have to support the company in Sömmerda. The developing Dreyse Mill, if subsidised, could eventually produce a lot of firearms for our country."
PRS_focus_suhl_rifle_factories:0 "Suhler Gewehrfabriken"
PRS_focus_suhl_rifle_factories_desc:0 "The small city of Suhl in the middle of Thuringia surprisingly has a rather rich history of rifle manufacturing. The companies of J.P. Sauer & Sohn, C.G. Haenel and Simson & Co. all enjoy a nationwide renown. Investing in these companies could help us to secure reliable and innovative firearm suppliers."
PRS_focus_erfurt_rifle_factory:0 "Königl. Preuß. Gewehrfabrik Erfurt"
PRS_focus_erfurt_rifle_factory_desc:0 "We will try to expand our military industry close to the Thuringian rifle heartlands and establish an arms factory in Erfurt. We hope that the factory site will profit from the expertise and economic infrastructure sorrounding it."

#Country Leader Descriptions
PRS_OTTO_THEODOR_VON_MANTEUFFEL_LEADER_DESC:0 "A highly successful political strongman and staunch pro-constitutional conservative, Otto Theodor von Manteuffel stands as Prussia's most influential proponent of constitutionalism. Having been raised in an aristocratic family, Manteuffel quickly picked up and mastered law and administration during his earlier years, so much so that he even garnered the interest of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. This new favoritism from the king, alongside his eagerness to prove his parliamentary skill, allowed him to gain influence and power within Prussian politics, having been given several different administrative and executive positions of ministry and power throughout his career. Despite his aristocratic connections, however, he was a staunch reformer, going so far as to say that Prussian politics needed to cease being governed 'like the landed estate of a nobleman.' Since December 1850, he has been Prime Minister of Prussia and has made numerous attempts to reform it, none of which have succeeded. Perhaps it's time for a change of guard in the Berliner Wilhelmsstraße?"
PRS_KARL_ANTON_VON_HOHENZOLLERN_SIGMARINGEN_LEADER_DESC:0 "Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is a prominent Junker aristocrat born into the same aristocratic house as King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, the House of Hohenzollern. Having abdicated as ruler of his family's small principality in favor of his distant cousin and close friend, Wilhelm I, he relinquished control of his principality after its annexation into Prussia. Coming from a military lineage, Prince Karl Anton served in the Prussian military and reached the rank of lieutenant general, even obtaining knighthood in the highest Prussian chivalric order, the Order of the Black Eagle. With a prestigious house name and royal lineage behind him, alongside a decorated military career, Karl Anton entered the field of politics and quickly rose to prominence within the Prussian political landscape. His and Wilhelm I's growing influence and ambitions within the [PRS.GetName] and its nobility have become the center stage of Prussian politics, with many rallying to their side against Manteuffel's rule."
PRS_ADOLF_ZU_HOHENLOHE_INGELFINGEN_LEADER_DESC:0 "Born to a noble family of military lineage, Prince Adolf Karl Friedrich Ludwig zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen served as both a 2nd lieutenant in the German Campaign of 1813 and as a member of the Prussian parliament from 1847-1854. Fiercely opposing any reforms made by the parliamentary conservatives and the popular liberal party, and being a staunch feudal-conservative, he advocates for Junker supremacy in German politics over the reforms of the more liberal bureaucratic-conservative and liberal-conservative parties of the 'New Era'. However, despite his decorated career, Prince Adolf Karl remains an inexperienced, albeit ambitious, politician."
PRS_OTTO_VON_BISMARCK_LEADER_DESC:0 "Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck was born on April 1, 1815, at his family's estate in the Prussian heartland west of Berlin. His family is of fifth-generation Junker aristocracy, and his mother comes from a long bloodline of successful academics and government ministers. Bismarck is known for the underplaying of his past, considerable intellect, and cosmopolitan outlook. Educated in Berlin and graduated from university, he took a series of minor diplomatic posts before retiring at age 24 to help run his family's estate in the village of Kneiphof. In 1847, he married Johanna von Puttkamer, the Duchess of Lauenburg and a Prussian noblewoman. Assigned as a delegate to the new Prussian parliament, where he would emerge as a reactionary voice against the anti-autocratic Revolution of 1848/49. His latest career has been as a Prussian diplomat, traveling Europe from St. Petersburg to Paris, giving him valuable insight into these two nations that Prussia is framed by, while attending conferences with French Emperor Napoleon III, and Tsar Alexander II. He also used to be the Prussian ambassador to the German Confederation in Frankfurt. His previous positions in Prussian, and the larger German politics, have given him great influence in political circles, which he has used to his advantage. Although feared by most moderate delegates for his staunchly conservative attitude, his ambitious ideas and revolutionary thinking may very well hold a few surprises in store."
PRS_FRIEDRICH_III_LEADER_DESC:0 "Son of King Wilhelm I and nephew of the late King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, young Friedrich was raised in the traditional Prussian way, involving both military and classical education. His experiences during the tumultuous period of the German Vormärz and his parents' failing marriage meant that the prince soon broke with the Hohenzollern tradition and pursued a formal education at the University of Bonn, in the heart of the more liberal Prussian Rhine Province. Here, Friedrich became acquainted with the liberal arts and progressive forms of governing, forming his rather liberal outlook on Prussian and German politics as a whole - a controversial stance among noblemen from high aristocracy. Both, his political persuasion and the engagement to Victoria, Princess Royal of the British Crown, were encouraged by monarchs of related families such as King Leopold I of Belgium and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Prince Consort to Queen Victoria, in an attempt to liberalize the Kingdom of Prussia and Germany from the inside. The young monarch now holds the keys to Prussia's future and only time will tell whether he can fulfil his destiny..."
PRS_GEORG_VON_VINCKE_LEADER_DESC:0 "Born in May 1811 in the Rhineland city of Hagen, von Vincke has build a formidable career as a politician, officer, landowner and high noble in the [PRS.GetName]. Having studied at the Unversity of Berlin and later at Göttingen, he served one year in the army voluntarily, and thereafter worked at courts in Berlin, Minden, and Münster. During the March Revolution of 1848/49, he we was a representative for Westphalia in the Frankfurt Parliment, where he would join the influential so-called 'Café Milani' faction. Regarded as a famous orator with his excellent writing skills and public voice, he would serve many jobs as a public speaker. Although an avid supporter of conservative values, he would change his political approach after Otto Theodor von Manteuffel took office as Prussian prime minister and turned into one of his most outspoken critics. An opponent of the Prussian envoy to the National Assembly in Frankfurt, Otto von Bismarck, the two nobleman duelled with pistols in 1852, which both men left without injury. Vincke has tried again and again to gain office as Prussian prime minister. Particularly with his anti-Polish stance many Prussians supported him for the office - and now it is time to prove himself worthy of this premature praise."
PRS_EDUARD_SIMSON_LEADER_DESC:0 "Born 1810 in Königsberg, East Prussia, into a Jewish family, Simson entered university in 1826 as a student of jurisprudence and law. He was most interested in Roman Law and even spent a year in Berlin to learn more on the topic, graduating with a Doctor Juris, after attending the École de Droit in Paris. Being a lead figure in both the Frankfurt Parliament and the short-lived Erfurt Parliament of 1850, he still exerts high influence in the [PRS.GetName]. With many influential roles across his career, he has become a well-known figure in Prussian politics and jurisdictions."
PRS_RUDOLF_VIRCHOW_LEADER_DESC:0 "Rudolf Virchow was born October 13, 1821, in the town of Schivelbein. The only son of his father, a farmer, and a representative in local government, he was a naughty child and poorly behaved. But, he was scholastically brilliant and showed much affection towards his talents in science, languages, and hard work. Taking unpaid assistant work at the Charité Hospital, the largest in Berlin, his position allowed him access to laboratories to pursue his studies. As a renowned reformer for modernity, he coined the phrase: 'Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale'. Being a co-founder of the 'Deutsche Fortschrittspartei', he has also proven his abilities and ambition in Prussian politics, and is being held in high regard across the political spectrum."
PRS_AUGUST_VON_DER_HEYDT_LEADER_DESC:0 "An influential German economist, August von der Heydt has held high positions in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, formed after the Revolutions of 1848. Born in 1801 in Elberfeld, Duchy of Berg, August was a smart student and soon rose up the ranks, being appointed by King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Starting in 1848, he has been in control of the nationalization of many private railway lines, having already bought a few in the name of the 'Preußische Staatseisenbahnen'. While attaining existing lines, he has also laid out plans to expand the railway network across the [PRS.GetName]. He was also responsible for managing most of the taxes across the country, reforming the mining industry by lowering the average tax, breaking up mining guilds, and ending state supervision. With his economic prowess, he has also helped increasing the circulation of currency, slowly replacing barter for currency trading and making the 'Vereinstaler' a valuable key currency in the Zollverein."
