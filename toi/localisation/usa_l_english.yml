 usa_worker_events.1.t:0 "New England Shoemakers Cut Wages!"
 usa_worker_events.1.d:0 "Shoemaker factories within the New England region have had to cut wage significantly during the economic panic! Many workers cite these wages are insuffiecent to live off of, but others say they can sustain it for a temporary time. Even so, many workers are content with simply having a job since many workers were fired during the economic panic."
 usa_worker_events.1.a:0 "Well, temporary wage cuts are understandable during this panic..."
 
 usa_worker_events.3.t:0 "The New England Mechanics Association"
 usa_worker_events.3.d:0 "The Panic of 1857 resulted in the temporary loss of jobs for many shoemakers. Workers were also angry at the increasing mechanization of the shoemaking process, discontent with the feeling of being replaced. When companies began hiring again, the cost of shoes went up and wages declined significantly. Many workers cited this increased revenue was soley going to the owner's pockets at the detriment of the living conditions for workers. Working hours were long, about 16 hours per day, and wages were low; men were earning only $3 a week and women just $1.\n\nThus the Mechanics Association was organized to negotiate conditions with employers, and demanded pre-panic wages or better."
 usa_worker_events.3.a:0 "This is an issue between the company and it's workers, not the government."
 usa_worker_events.3.b:0 "Recognize them and give this organization support!"
 
 usa_worker_events.4.t:0 "The New England Shoemaker Strike!"
 usa_worker_events.4.d:0 "After a week of failed attempts of negotiation between factory employers and the New England Mechanics Association, And so they walked off the job on Washington’s birthday because it was a 'fitting day for a blow in favor of the cause you engage in.'\n\nReporters covered the mass meeting at Lyceum Hall in Lynn, calling it the ‘largest and most enthusiastic of its kind ever held in New England.’ The workers set up committees of 100 men each to post the names of scabs, to keep order and to make sure shoes wouldn’t be finished elsewhere. They then marched to their factories and handed in their tools.\n\n'I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to labor whether you pay them or not,' wrote Abraham Lincoln. 'I like a system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere.'"
 usa_worker_events.4.a:0 "Oh."
 usa_worker_events.4.a:0 "Let's hope that doesnt inspire strikes here..."
 
 usa_worker_events.5.t:0 "The New England Shoemaker Strike Ends!"
 usa_worker_events.5.d:0 "There was no rowdyism, and the strike leaders strongly discouraged alcohol. The strikers enjoyed community support, with businessmen contributing money and groceries and clergy denouncing the employers from their pulpits. When Boston police arrived at the train station, a crowd of 8,000 people jeered and hissed at them.\n\nThe employers were ready to raise wages by the second week of the shoemakers  strike, but refused to recognize the union. On April 10, a thousand Lynn workers went back on the job after 30 employers agreed to raise wages by 10 percent. Some held out for a few weeks longer, but the shoemakers strike had ended.\n\nThe women had already gone back to work. Though the men supported them, they didn’t include the women’s wage demands in their proposals. They were concerned the employers wouldn’t consider their demands if they added the women’s.\n\nSome employers did sign agreements with the local unions. Most of the male workers got a raise, and unions organized where previously they hadn’t existed. As the Haverhill Gazette reported, “An Association of mechanics will grow out of the movement which will doubtless do much for the protection of the laborers in their rights.”"
 usa_worker_events.5.a:0 "Well, at least it's over..."

 USA_buchanan_deny_scott_desc:0 "The case of Dred Scott v. Sanford has brought the question of slavery into the headlines once again, and now, the highest court in the land is taking up the burden of answering it. To prevent a decision made along partisan lines, President-elect Buchanan sees it fit to pressure a northern justice into taking a pro-slavery stance. If he succeeds, we just might avoid calls of judicial bias against our already-fragile government."
 USA_buchanan_address_debate:0 "Address the Debate"
 USA_buchanan_address_debate_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Scott case, long rising tensions between North and South, Free and Slave have been brought more fully into the light. Unfortunately for us, there is practically no chance of the crisis ending on it's own as Buchanan had hoped. Because of this, we must take a stance, as not committing will certainly lead to disaster. This stance will manifest in our cabinet, which we have not yet appointed. In the Cabinet, we can either favor Southern Democrats and the Northerners allied with them, or, we can appoint a compromise cabinet and hope to save our party."

 USA_inclusive_cabinet:0 "An Inclusive Cabinet"
 USA_inclusive_cabinet_desc:0 "Though it would be best if appointed officials who were strictly loyal to the President, the feud between Buchanan and the moderate Stephen Douglas, who champions the cause of 'Popular Sovereignty' or letting all states decide whether to be slave states or not, could tear our party apart."
 USA_purge_unreliables:0 "Purge Unreliables"

 USA_covode_committee_desc:0 "The Covode Committee was convened in the House of Representatives to investigate alleged abuses and corruption by the President, going so far as searching for grounds to Impeach the President and remove him from office. Though ultimately unsuccessful it served as a lightning rod for intra-party disagreements within the democratic party which ultimately potentially contributed to Buchanan's chosen sucessor coming in 3rd for the popular vote later that year."

 USA_mormon_alaska_desc:0 "One of Buchanan's strangest ideas was an early purchase of Russian Alaska, with the intent of offering it to the Mormon Church, potentially seeing this as a clever way of both gaining land and settlers for a harsh frontier, and the Mormon's potentially would've taken such an offer, in their continual pursuit of lands where they could be left alone without threat of violence.

 #Western Expansion Events
 usa_western_expansion.2.t:0 "Pikes Peak's Gold Rush!"
 usa_western_expansion.2.d:0 "For many years, people had suspected the mountains of Colorado contained numerous rich gold deposits. This rumor all began in 1835, when a French trapper named Eustace Carriere lost his party and ended up wandering through the mountains for many weeks. During those weeks he found many gold specimens which he later took back to New Mexico for examination. Upon examination, they turned out to be 'pure gold'. But when he tried to lead an expedition back to the location of where he found the gold, they came up short because he could not quite remember the location.\n\nBut many kept searching for the gold in those Rocky Mountains and several small parties explored the region. In July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622 grams) of gold, which would start up the town of Denver.\n\nBut that discovery wouldnt be contained for long, for in the winter of last year this secret was exposed! If you want to mine gold yourself, spring is here and everyone is rushing to Denver! If you're worried that the early birds took it all, dont!

 usa_western_expansion.19.d:0 "Issac Stevens was a controversial governor during his time in office, for his role in compelling the Native American tribes of Washington Territory by intimidation and force to sign treaties that ceded most of their lands and rights to Stevens' government. These included the Treaty of Medicine Creek, Treaty of Hellgate, Treaty of Neah Bay, Treaty of Point Elliott, Point No Point Treaty, and Quinault Treaty. During this time, the Governor imposed martial law to better impose his will on the Indians and whites who opposed his views. The consequent political and legal battles would soon overshadow the Indian war.\n\nIn April 1856, Governor Stevens removed settlers whom he believed to be aiding the enemy (in many cases because they had married into local tribes) and placing them in the military's custody. Governor Stevens declared martial law in Pierce County in order to conduct a military trial of those settlers. He next declared martial law in Thurston County. But only the territorial legislature had the authority to declare martial law, and representatives fought Stevens' effort to abrogate their authority. A bitter political and legal battle ensued. On May 24, 1856, following a legal opinion rendered by Judge Chenoweth, ruling that Stevens had no legal power to declare martial law, Governor Stevens rescinded his proclamation in Pierce and Thurston counties.\n\nStevens did not hesitate to use his troops for vengeance, and waged a brutal winter campaign against the Yakama tribe, led by Chief Kamiakin. This, along with his unjustified execution of the Nisqually chieftain Leschi, led to widespread pleas to President Pierce to remove Stevens from his post. Two men were particularly vocal in their opposition to Stevens and his policies; territorial Judge Edward Lander and influential private citizen Ezra Meeker. While Meeker was ignored, Lander was arrested by Stevens' forces due to his opposition. Pierce refused to remove Stevens from his position, but eventually sent word to the governor expressing his disapproval. Any opposition eventually died down, as most white settlers in Washington Territory felt that Stevens was on 'their side', while they considered Meeker to be too sympathetic to Native Americans."

 USA_utah_war_start.1.t:0 "The Utah War"
 USA_utah_war_start.1.d:0 "The Utah War, also known as the Mormon War for the the participation of the Mormon Church, was a brief period of political instability between the Utah Territorial Government and the US Federal Government. There were many causes, including a long history of religious oppression against the Mormon people, including being driven out of more eastern states by state-sanctioned violence, the duality of governance in the territory between the federally directed government and the ecclesiastic fovernment of the church, and by a gross ineptitude of communication and mistrust between both sides. The actual start of the conflict started when newly elected James Buchanan appointed a new governor for the territory, replacing the then current governor who was also the head of the Mormon Church, and dispatching a military escort with policing powers. The Mormons feared a new wave of federal persecution, and so refused to admit the new governor to the territory without conflict. Historically both sides eventually reached a diplomatic settlement that saw the Mormons' rights, never in real danger, respected, and federal authority respected and transition of power to a new governor."

 USA_utah_war.1.t:0 "Buchanan Revokes New Governor!"
 USA_utah_war.1.d:0 "Buchanan, seeing how unpopular replacing Governor Brigham Young with Alfred Cumming, has decided to rescind the replacement altogether. The President's own party sees this quick cave to Mormon pressure as an embarrassment, and isn't expected to resolve the crisis alone either."
 USA_utah_war.1.a:0 "What was he thinking?"
 USA_utah_war.2.t:0 "Buchanan Revokes Posse Commitatus!"
 USA_utah_war.2.d:0 "Buchanan, seeing how sending a military force would only inflame tensions, and acting as Commander-In-Chief, has recalled the regular army units originally sent to escort the new governor, they will return to Kansas to continue trying to keep order amidst the civil unrest there. From what we've heard of the Mormons preparations for their defense, this will surely lead to our replacement Governor's capture or worse, and certainly an embarrassment for the current administration. Memebers of Congress have already sent us official notes asking for us to defend government officials in executing their lawful duties from insurrectionists."

 USA_utah_war.6.d:0 "In discussions with select members of Congress, Buchanan has spoken at great length how Mormon dissedents are no different from other great traitors from US history like Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr (look it up). If it was the President's aim to calm tensions, at least part of that progress has been lost, however members of the president's party have been impressed by the President's resolve."

 USA_utah_war.7.t:0 "Buchanan Pardons Dissenters!"
 USA_utah_war.7.d:0 "President Buchanan has preemptively pardoned those who are ralling to defend themselves from what they view as Government aggression.

Upon his arrival in the city, he was immediately granted a private audience with Brigham Young who questioned him on the current crisis. The captain's calm reassurance regarding the troops explicit \"Self-defense only\" orders and that this was only a routine change in governors which, while potentially politically motivated, was not part of an anti-Mormon plot. While mildly reassured, the city remains on edge and the Governor has declared martial law."

 USA_utah_war.9.t:0 "Buchanan Dispatches Special Negotiator!"
 USA_utah_war.9.d:0 "The President had dispatched a high-ranking official of his party to negotiate with the Mormons and try and make them see reason. However it seems this party loyalist was perhaps too loyal. Instead of trying to reassure the locals, he insulted them, and then made . . . indiscreet remarks concerning Easterner opinions on Mormon religious beliefs. To say this individual's stay in the Utah Territroy was brief is putting mildly."
 USA_utah_war.9.a:0 "You had one job! ONE!"
 USA_utah_war.10.t:0 "Buchanan Dispatches Special Negotiator!"
 USA_utah_war.10.d:0 "In this time of crisis, a private citizen has reached out to us, an individual by the name of Thomas L. Kane. They have worked closely with Mormons in the past, helping them migrate to more remote lands out west where they would be safer from religious persecution, and is thus fondly remembered by the Mormon people. They had volunteered to meet with the Mormon leadership to negotiate asettlement or start a peace process, or help in someway that war be prevented. After traveling south across teh gulf of mexico, across the Trans-Panamanian Railway, and North up the Pacific Coast, landing in California, and making their way East across the Rocky Mountains, they have met with both Brigham Young and the Commander of the US Army escort and Governor Alfred Cummings. He has negotiated as a start to the peace process the admittance of Cummings to the territory, his safety guaranteed, and an end to the Mormon's Fabian tactics while the peace process continues to develop."

 USA_utah_war.11.d:0 "An expedition under one Lt. Ives was recently dispatched to explore the navigability of the Colorado River. However with this crisis upon us, President Buchanan and the War Department have seen refit to redefine his mission to explore how feasible attacking Utah from the south is. To make a long story short, his mission has been discovered by the Mormons, further raising tensions, despite a technical failure of the mission to find a navigable-enough route."
 USA_utah_war.11.a:0 "Perhaps a subtler approach is called for"
 USA_utah_war.12.t:0 "President Buchanan's Folly"
 USA_utah_war.12.d:0 "The President has today proposed what he calls \"Killing several birds with one stone!\" a scheme, yes SCHEME, so seemingly ludicrous . . . it might work? Consider this, Buchanan is openly expansionist and wants to see the US' borders grow; The Mormons moved to desolate Utah with the explicit purpose of minimizing contact with the outside world; AND, in the wake of the Crimean War the Russian Empire has many debts to pay and has never viewed their colony in Alaska as particularly worthwhile, hosting only a small sealing outpost, and would rather profit off its sale than see it fall to its arch-rival Britain in a theoretical next war. With all this in mind, Buchanan has proposed buying Alaska from Russia, and offering it as a settlement to the Mormons, not as a banishment, but additional land which they might secure themselves in. Russia gets its money, the Mormons get a guaranteed haven, and Buchanan grows the US with ready settlers."
 USA_utah_war.12.a:0 "Buchanan, Winning so much we're tired of it"
 USA_utah_war.13.t:0 "Buchanan Guarantees Religious Equality"
 USA_utah_war.13.d:0 "Today Buchanan, seeking to calm tensions, has issued an executive order directing that, while already guaranteed freedom of religion under the 1st Amendment, federal officials must seek to ensure people of all religions are treated and protected equally under the law. (This will later be codified in a certain 14th amendment)"
 USA_utah_war.13.a:0 "Lady Justice must be Blind!"
 USA_utah_war.14.t:0 "President Buchanan Orders Ecclesiastic Courts Closed!"
 USA_utah_war.14.d:0 "Part of the underlying issues that led to this crisis was the dual-administration of both ecclesiatic and secular bodies, Mormon leaders would advise all adherents to seek justice within the confines of the church instead of in a court of law. Buchanan today demanded that part of any peace agreement must be a close of these ecclesiastic courts."
 USA_utah_war.14.a:0 "Justice in Man's Court, not God's"
 USA_utah_war.15.t:0 "Buchanan Closes the Borders of Utah Territory!"
 USA_utah_war.15.d:0 "Today the President closed the borders of the Utah Territories, still de-jure under his control, in an attempt to prevent the Mormon people from receiving assistance from their network of missionaries abroad and more locally from sympathizers in other states. Some question whether the constitution provides for such authority and legal action has already been initiated by private citizens."
 USA_utah_war.15.a:0 "What's next, Habeus Corpus?"
 USA_utah_war.16.t:0 "Buchanan Demands the Nauvoo Legion Disband!"
 USA_utah_war.16.d:0 "The Nauvoo Legion, the militia theoretically comprised of every able-bodied male of the Mormon Church, was first formed when the church was centered in Illinois, and in close contact with hostile Christians of other denominations. Brigham Young has reactivated the unit to defend the territory during this crisis, but President Buchanan has demanded it disband before any conclusion to the crisis can occur. The President's party appreciates such a bold move."
 USA_utah_war.16.a:0 "What does Nauvoo even mean?"
 USA_utah_war.17.t:0 "Buchanan Pressures Native Tribes!"
 USA_utah_war.17.d:0 "The President has begun a secret campaign of pressuring the various native tribes surrounding the Utah Territory to harass the Mormons to draw away some of their forces from harassing Federal forces in the area. Some of the tribes have members who are friends with the Mormons, and so word has gotten back to them about the President's efforts."
 USA_utah_war.17.a:0 "Probably wouldnt have worked either"
 USA_utah_war.18.t:0 "Buchanan Orders Troops to Echo Canyon"
 USA_utah_war.18.d:0 "Buchanan has been aware for some time about the Mormons building defenses in Echo Canyon, a short ways north of Salt Lake City and on a direct route to the city. The ongoing crisis, which has battered his administration, has finally pushed him to drastic action. He has ordered Federal Troops to escort the new Governor to Salt Lake City through Echo Canyon, and although they are ordered not to shoot first, accidents can happen in tense situation. Either they or the Mormons will shoot, and this crisis has yet to reach its climax."
 USA_utah_war.18.a:0 "How can this solve anything?"
 USA_utah_war.19.t:0 "Buchanan Orders Troops to Avoid Mormon Defenses!"
 USA_utah_war.19.d:0 "Because of the Mormons openly fortifying the pass at Echo Canyon, Buchanan has ordered troops to find another entrance into the Utah Territory. Because of the constant harrassment of troops, scarce supplies, and shifting weather, it is not expected that thye will be successful before the situation changes in another way."
 USA_utah_war.19.a:0 "Let us hope they are not needed"
 USA_utah_war.20.t:0 "Buchanan Increases Military Escort!"

 USA_utah_war.24.d:0 "President Buchanan has decided to employ another negotiating tactic to further ease tensions with the Mormons. He has decided to offer them an expedited path to Statehood. This is likely to prove enticing to the Mormons, because of they are granted statehood, Governors will be decided by local election instead of federal appointment."

 USA_utah_war.94.d:0 "Despite superiority of numbers for the US Army, the Mormon defenses are revealed to be the deciding factor!

 USA_utah_war.96.d:0 "Despite the eruption of hostilities recently between the Mormon Church and the Federal Government, and the apparent disparity of forces involved, the US government has essentially given up. Be it military failures or a new political strategy, they seem to have decided they will no longer pursue the reintegration of Utah by force at this time.

As a staunch believer of Manifest Destiny, he cheered the Mexican Cession which resulted in the US annexing much of Mexico in the 1840s. Now he wishes to purchase the Island of Cuba from the Spanish Government, not only to expand America, but also to add another potential slave state to the US to grow support for slavery in the US Senate. However this will undoubtedly be incredibly expensive, as the island is incredibly profitable and Spain is in dire financial straits and sees the island as their one reliable source of income."

Cuba has been the jewel of our empire for centuries, and remains the most profitable part of it today. It has been part of Spain so long it is as much a part of Spain as Castille or Aragon. Selling it could cost us much in the long run but we are nearing bankruptcy now. How should we proceed?"

POLITICS_JAMES_BUCHANAN_DESC:0 "President James Buchanan, a member of the Democratic Party, is the current leader of the executive branch. He rose to power by defeating former president Franklin Pierce, Senator Stephen A. Douglas, and Lewis Cass in the Democratic National Convention as well as beating John C. Frémont of the Republican party and former president Millard Filmore of the Know Nothing party in the general election. He has a long political history, starting as a state Assemblyman in Pennsylvania, then going to represent his state in congress, before being appointed as the Secretary of State under James K. Polk’s presidency. Although born in a free state, his views align heavily with southern principles, thus many anti-slavery northerners refer to him as a doughface politician. He is a staunch believer in state’s rights, and a hawkish expansionist."
