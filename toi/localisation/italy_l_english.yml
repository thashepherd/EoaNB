 PIE_italian_national_society:0 "Italian National-Society"
 PIE_italian_national_society_desc:0 "The Italian National Society is an organization originally established to promote and spread nationalism to political moderates in Piedmont. Since it’s foundation, it’s raised a large sum of funds through a multitude of fundraisers, planned events, and won over the support of a multitude of Publishers. Now, with the dominant support of the middle class, the National Society has begun a wildly popular propaganda campaign in advocation for the unification of Piedmont and Lombardy, and even as far as the expulsion of Austrian influence over Italy."
 PIE_spearheading_risorgimento:0 "Spearheading the Risorgimento"
 PIE_spearheading_risorgimento_desc:0 "While nationalism destroys empires, it also builds nations. Italy will be one of the countries to form from the territory of crumbling empires. Between 1815 and 1848, fewer and fewer Italians have been content to live under foreign rulers. Public outrage over foreign monopolies, standard of living, and political divide has reached an all time high. Most Italian nationalists look for leadership from the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, the most powerful and politically connected of the states, as well as the only Italian state with Italian native royalty. Sardinia has surged from the ashes of it’s first attempt at unification, and regained it’s respect in the Crimean war, to the majority within the Sardinian middle class, Sardinia-Piedmont holds the future of Italy in its hands."
 PIE_perfect_fusion:0 "Perfect Fusion"
 PIE_perfect_fusion_desc:0 "In 1847, a segment of the Sardinian elites from Cagliari and Sassari, led by the unionist Giovanni Siotto Pintor, demanded the so-called Perfect Fusion, making it so that Sardinia could get the liberal reforms that were not available for the island because of its separate legal system. A new legal system entered into force in Sardinia, and the last viceroy, Claudio Gabriele de Launay, left Cagliari on 4 March 1848. The island was divided into three provinces ruled by their prefects, following the system already used in Piedmont since 1815."
 PIE_sardinian_question:0 "Sardinian Question"
 PIE_sardinian_question_desc:0 "Sardinians lost their former powers of taxation and autonomous representation in exchange for the Piedmontese parliament taking over legislative responsibility on the island, and some seats in the Congress following the so-called ‘Perfect Fusion’. While the Centralization allowed for the stabilization of economic growth, improved national coherency, and eased difficulty for passing new legislations, it also left Sardinia being an even less significant overseas department of the Savoyard domains, angering many native Sardinian intellectuals. If left unchecked, tensions between Sardinia and the mainland could develop."
 PIE_piedmontese_militarism:0 "Piedmontese Militarism"

To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

However, Nigra informed Henri of an already existing alliance between Russia and Sardinia-Piedmont which is now cause for concern in the French leadership.

Along with this disgracful marriage, it is expected that France will seek to regain the territories of Savoy and Nice which were lost after the Congress of Vienna.

The obvious options are to use the war to enfore trade treaty violations by Austria and her minor state allies in the peninsula, but there is a chance that this might be seen as a weak reason for war by the European powers. Another option is to use the presence of Austrian troops in Rome and Bologna as a justification for war, which might gain some favor among the European powers. However, the French are also stationing troops in Rome, so the parallels may be too similar to use it as a justification."

sardinia.96.t:0 "Casus Belli"
sardinia.96.d:0 "The other side of our alliance has offered up two possible casus belli that could be used against the Austrians. However, neither are suitable to use in order to wage a war of the scale we need to. The proposed casus belli's being enforcing trade treaty obligations, and using the Bologna Garrison by the Austrians as an excuse for war. With the parallels between our troops in Rome and the Austrians in Bologna, using that as a casus belli could be seen as hypocritical. The trade treaty obligations would not be strong enough to be seen as legitimate cause for war."

sardinia.97.d:0 "With our confirming that the two prior suggested Casus Belli would be too weak to wage a war on, our politicians have managed to formulate quite the plan in order to not only provide a cause for war, but to ensure Austria is the attacker. Using the fact that Duchy of Medna and Reggio leader Francis V had refused to accept Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the Modense citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-Allied government it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opprotunity to make a statement about Austrian influence in the Italian Peninsula without directly going to war. The outrage in Vienna might just be enough to cause them to go to war."

sardinia.99.d:0 "The Political structure of Italy, should the war against Austria go well, is something that might cause some fracturing in the alliance. With the ultimate French goal to regain influence in the peninsula lost in the Congress of Vienna - through the means of an Italian Confederation, and the goal of Piedmont being creating at least a northern Italian Kingdom. Hopes of Piedmont for complete unification are not to be ignored, however."
sardinia.99.a:0 "This will be an interesting topic"
sardinia.100.t:0 "Our Position on the Confederation"
sardinia.100.d:0 "As the French prepare to lay out their plan for the Italian Peninsula, we must begin to think about whether the confederation is something that we should go along with. Naturally, we can always give the French our assurances now and see if the future allows us to change the agreement, but we are not in a good position to deny the French goal of domination in Italy. With that we are stuck in this position, with the hope to escape at first chance or at the very least to renegociate the terms of the confederation."
sardinia.100.a:0 "We will see what the future holds"
sardinia.101.t:0 "The North of Italy"
sardinia.101.d:0 "Under the current plans for the political structure of Italy, the north of the peninsula would be under control of Sardinia-Piedmont under the title of a Kingdom of Northern Italy. This would see the Austrians removed from Northern italy and replaced with a more powerful Italian state."
sardinia.101.a:0 "Interesting"
sardinia.102.t:0 "Central Italy"
sardinia.102.d:0 "Central Italy under the confederation would be under control of a French allied state. Given the current association of the central states with Austria, a new monarch may have to be found but the current regent in Parma the lady of Artois has had her named tossed around as a possible leader of this Napoleonic-esque central state. The Pope would remain in Rome as the head of the Italian Confederation."
sardinia.102.a:0 "Hmmm"
sardinia.104.t:0 "The South of Italy"
sardinia.104.d:0 "In the South of Italy the current Bourbon monarchy would likely be replaced with a relative of the French Bonapartes, unless the Two Sicilies can be convinvec of the merits of joining the confederation. With British interests in the Sulphur mines of Sicily this could cause a confilct between our nations as the balance of power in Europe is drawn into question."

sardinia.105.d:0 "After a long day of negociations, promising, and signings the second day of talks in the carriage around Plombieres is set to begin. The topics of the Second Day are to finalize the terms of a Franco-Sardinian alliance and some of the diplomatic proceedings."
sardinia.105.a:0 "Lets get it going"
sardinia.106.t:0 "Military Composition"
sardinia.106.d:0 "The first, and maybe one of the biggest, topics of maybe the entire meeting is on the military composition of the alliance. Given the war against Austria is over Italian soil we are eager to have the lead against Austria, and in order to revenge the defeat in 1848. For the French the importance to show dominance in italy and revenge the Congress of Vienna is aparant. Whoever leads the military alliance will have quite the benefit in the war."
sardinia.106.a:0 "Allow the French to lead"
sardinia.106.b:0 "Request that we lead"
sardinia.107.t:0 "The Military Composition"
sardinia.107.d:0 "As the Piedmontese have sent their request for how the military alliance will be structured, and who will ultimately lead the efforts against Austria there is much to consider. As the dominant power in Europe compared to the Italians it would be more appropriate for us to lead the armies in Italy, however, the Italians are very nationalistic people and the presence of strong Italian leaders could pay off to rally the populace and inspire troops. Either way, the leader of the war will be an important position."
sardinia.107.a:0 "Accept Lead"
sardinia.107.b:0 "Deny Piedmont Lead, We just take charge"
sardinia.107.c:0 "Give the Italians Command"
sardinia.110.t:0 "The Royal Marriage"
sardinia.110.d:0 "To seal the deal in the new alliance, the French have desired to have Napoleon III's rather disgraceful cousin marry the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel. There are many reasons as to why the King has been hesitant. The Emperor's brother is not known for his loyalty to companions, and his age difference between the kings daughter it not to ignored. It would not be a honorous marriage for the Italian people, but the king is willing to sacrifice in order to secure the alliance."
