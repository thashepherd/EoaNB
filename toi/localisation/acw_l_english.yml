The regionalism of the states separated them from each other, creating rivalries between themselves. This tore into the young republic, as states refused to pay taxes and the army was threatening to mutiny. Many consider it a miracle that our nation survived such times, and it was because of the disposal of the Articles of Confederation, and its replacement by the Constitution. \n \nHowever, it would be an incorrect statement to say the regionalist ideals died out. Many within the country first consider themselves of their state, secondly of their region, and thirdly as an American. Some still see us as more of an Alliance, rather than a nation. After all, it is not 'the' United States, it is 'these' United States."

It became even more divided as it was discovered that the Assassin was a Radical Republican, and likely assassinated the President due to his lenient stance toward the Confederacy. The Democratic representatives claimed that they now fear for their lives, and some have begun to adopt Conspiracies about the assassination. \n \nWith the death of two Presidents in a row, the nation is showing signs of collapse, unless the Republican Speaker of the House, William Pennington, can somehow reestablish order, however unlikely."

This culminated last night as the President was taking Morphine to deal with his stress, and accidentally died from an overdose. \n \nAfter being discovered an hour after his death, there were attempts by the members of the White House in an attempt to secure the safety of the nation, but once news finally reached the people, outrage erupted across the nation. The Government has not been able to properly operate with the death of 3 different executives within days of each other, and many have begun to lose faith in the Union. The Radical Republican, Moderate Republican, and remaining Democratic members of Congress debated how to proceed, they agreed to continue the line of succession, however the President Pro Tempore has come under debate. Many Republicans are unsatisfied with Jesse D. Bright, who was a Democrat, and did not want him to become the next President. Instead, they proposed Solomon Foot as the Moderate Republican choice, and the Radicals presenting Benjamin Wade as a potential candidate, splitting the Congressional halls as they endlessly debated how they should proceed and who should become the next President. \n \nWith the inability of Congress to be able to operate, and protests occurring all across the country, it seems as though the Union's days may be numbered."
