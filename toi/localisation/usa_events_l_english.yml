 # Introduction to the United States
 usa_intro.1.t:0 "The Divided States of America"
 usa_intro.1.d:0 "It is a bleak time for the United States, as tensions relating to the issue of slavery are once again causing great divides within the young republic. Many, especially New England, see the practice as immoral while others, in the south justify Slavery for its clear economic benefit. Although the country has taken some strides toward ending slavery, such as the 1807 Prohibition of Importation of Slaves Act, the continued need to keep the union together has always taken precedence. \n \nColumbia is now at a crossroads, however. With the recent Mexican Cession and Annexation of Oregon Country, the western frontier is as wide as ever and there are many questions pertaining on whether Slavery should be allowed to be spread west too. For many in the South, expansion is a definite yes. Three decades earlier, the Missouri Compromise stipulated that all land beneath the 36°30' line shall be admitted as Slaves states. To others in the north, the view the possibility of Slavery spreading anywhere to be abhorent. If Slavery could spread to Texas and California, will it be eventually be spread to Mexico and Cuba as well, two places many Americans were considering annexing as well.\n \nWhile compromises like the Fugitive Slave Act and Kansas-Nebraska Act have been reached in hopes to mitigate the ever increasing tensions, Columbia is now at a crossroads. Violence between Abolitionists and Pro-Slavery activists have occurred in Maryland, Virgina, Missouri and Kansas. Distrust between Americans are never higher and to make things worse, a new abolitionist party — the Republicans — have gained much national support on the platform of abolishing Slavery entirely, to the dismay of Southerners.\n \nThe future of the United States is in question."

 usa_intro.2.t:0 "A Nation Rebuilding"
 usa_intro.2.d:0 "The United States is a country in the midst of rebuilding itself. After a brutal Civil War that has left entire states savaged and hundreds of thousands dead, the nation has much to remorse over.\n \n Despite this, the United States is on the rise. The government, now strongly secured with Republican Majorities, is no longer divided against itself like decades past. The economy, revitalized from years of turmoil by the War is quickly industrializing — and with help of a new generation of inventors, is the more technological in the world. Finally, the newly modernized US Military is the largest in the world. It is now longer in question whether the United States is a world power."

It seems as though the only ones that would refuse this were the rich White plantation owners in the South and radical abolitionists in the North, who have lost support when the Referendum had been announced. \n \nThere are four different plans for a Referendum. 1: The Abolition Plan, which, if passed, would ban the practice of Slavery, 2: The Popular Sovereignty Plan, on which people can vote if their state wants or doesn't want slavery, 3: The 30 Years' Plan, where the US would slowly cut down on Slavery until total abolition is achieved in a span of about 30 years, or 4: The Reformed Slavery Plan, which promises to implement a form of Slavery that prohibits harsh treatment of Slaves. \n \nThe time to choose is now, the fate of the nation is in our hands..."

Although this will upset some of the Radicals from both sides, this has drastically calmed tensions on both sides of the debate. It seems like John Bell has brought the nation together, and has finally solved the issue on slavery.

It would give the Federal Government much more power to enforce Non-Discrimination throughout the country. Although it is still facing resistance in Congress and by the People, and it won't immediately solve race issues. If we were to push this bill forward we may be able to pass it."

As the Panic of 1857 hits the village, it has effected its ability to perform labor, and people are now being forced to travel out of the community for work.

The vast majority of the support granted to Modern Times was given by New York City, but other than that there is a mixed reaction. The troubling part of this, however, is the fact that Modern Times is beginning to support radical ideas of socialism and communism, calling on the fact that the govnerment and capitalism is failing the community.

However, there are three disputed states: South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana where none have secured an overwhelming victory. The 20 electoral votes from these states could win the Republicans their nomination, and there are some Democratic Congressmen offering a compromise to gain these votes: the removal of federal troops in the South. Should we accept the terms of the compromise, we would secure the presidency away from the Democratic Party, at the cost of allowing the Redeemers to take over the South. However, if we don't accept this, it would be handing over the electoral votes in a silver platter to Tilden, and make us lose our grip at the White House, at least for four years, but we will retain our control in the South.

They have reasoned out to Lincoln that two Republicans controlling the two key positions for the upcoming elections just made them believe of the "lies" that was spread, and a "scam" to attract support when in reality it is just a renamed Republican Party. After denouncing the coalition, the disgruntled War Democrats reconciled with its Copperhead counterparts and therefore strengthening the Democratic Party in the upcoming elections. This disastrous decision made Lincoln to ponder whether his position is still secure, as the nation is once more invigorated with a party divide while the nation is fighting the rebellious Southern states."

 usa.194.d:0 "With a Republican-dominated Congress, the unpopular president Andrew Johnson had to deal with the opposition when he tried to pass laws to the Congress to admit the Southern States as soon as possible, and strived for a more moderate Reconstruction. These decisions made him unpopular especially to the Radical Republicans, who had constituted to reestablish their Republican Party months when Lincoln was assassinated. Johnson's incapability to maintain the coalition can be partly blamed to his pro-Democrat policies, instead of appeasing the other side as well.

Since most of the Greenback Party's appeal to the labor unions declined in the 1880s, the party followed suit, along with its eventual dissolution in 1889. However, some hopeful former Greenbacks under James B. Weaver's leadership hoped to restore the confidence of the labor unions under a new party, the People's Party, mostly known to the United States as the Populist Party. Unlike the advocacy of greenback monetary policy, the Populists advocated the system of bimetallism, which also appealed to some Democrats, and absorbing the small Union Labor Party as well. With an enlargened support base, Weaver hopes that they could introduce the policy to the Congress, and perhaps finally remove some dependence to the gold standard."
