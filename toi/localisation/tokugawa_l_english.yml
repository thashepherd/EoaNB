  feudal_tokugawa_shogunate.1.d_shogunate:0 "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan has undergone an era of unprecedented unity, stability, and progress under his family's reign. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the bakufu capital, would see the beginnings of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea under the policy of sakoku, or closed country, enacted between 1633-1639. With its strong isolationist stance, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and other Western influences within the country, maintaining its independence, at the cost of sealing off contact with modern innovations, save for a small Dutch trading post in the bay of Nagasaki called Dejima. Although contacts with the Dutch were limited, Japanese scholars were able to obtain a fair amount of knowledge on modern medicine and technology through the Rangaku studies, but the country as a whole still lagged far behind the West. \n \nThis 220-year paradigm, and the peace that came with it, suddenly came to a screeching halt when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853 and demanded that Japan end its long period of isolation and adopt formal trade relations with the US. To back up his demands were the might of his powerful steamships, which the Japanese called the black ships because of the color of the warships and the smoke that belched out of their coal-fired steam engines. The Shogunate, virtually threatened at gunpoint to end sakoku, finally agreed to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry on March 31, 1854. The terms of the Convention agreed to the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, ensured the safety of American castaways, and established an American consul in Japan. \n \nThe aftermath of the Convention would cast a huge shadow of doubt over the Shogun's historical responsibility to oppose Western encroachment into Japan, and it was the catalyst for the rise of the Sonno Joi movement, or the belief that the Shogun was no longer capable of resisting the West, and that the Emperor should be entrusted with such an important role. With the security of Japan deeply threatened, the Shogunate overturned many of its policies restricting its naval capabilities in 1855, and desperately sought to improve the strength of its defenses as quickly as possible. However, centuries of peace have atrophied the fighting capability of Japanese troops, and with growing discontent from the historically hostile tozama daimyo, the Shogunate is quickly approaching its day of reckoning..."

Some of our elders warn that this plague is an effect of evil spirits purposely brought to Japan by the West while others believe it is Japan's spirits punishment on Kyushu's love for Western teachings.
