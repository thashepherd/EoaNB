It established local education authorities with defined powers, authorized public money to improve existing schools, and tried to frame conditions attached to this aid so as to earn the goodwill of managers. It was long been seen as a milestone in educational development, but recent commentators have stressed that it brought neither free nor compulsory education, and its importance has thus tended to be diminished rather than increased.[The law was drafted by William Forster, a Liberal MP, and it was introduced on 17 February 1870 after campaigning by the National Education League, although not entirely to their requirements. In Birmingham, Joseph Chamberlain, not yet a Member of Parliament, was a prominent campaigner on the issue. However, like many grassroots Liberals he opposed the bill because it was open to the possibility of subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money."

Most notably the current Sepoy Mutiny, The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the East India Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.\n \nThe Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. The rebellion poses a considerable threat to British power in that region. If our forces are unable to deal with this threat, our position as the globe's greatest power will be questionable - both at home and abroad…\n\nWith the dawn of the industrial revolution there are many advancements in technology that must be implemented and changes in society must also be made. Similarly, the status of Ireland has been in question in recent years. With increasing unrest in the region, over time we will be questioned on how to deal with this situation to ensure we remain in control of Ireland.\n\nWe will have to be cautious in the coming years and choose our path wisely, the slightest wrong choice could cause the end of the British Empire."

Many a rebellion have had to be put down up to today, and rising republican sentiments among the native Irish have recently been fanned by a major independence movement calling themselves the 'Fenians'. Their message of demanding an Irish nation free from Great Britain has proven very appealing to our Irish subjects.\n\nTheir message of achieving this through violence, however, has proven to be a major headache for our Governor.

 britainfocus.20.d:0 "His Royal Highness Prince Albert, wants to make Britiain a better place to work with his new Ideas. However, we must persuade him of our ways and show him that they work. Regardless of cost. If we have his support, many in the nation will rally behind our reforms."

This party, formerly the Whigs, was centralized around reducing the power of the Crown in favor of the Parliament. The Reform Act was perhaps the peak Whig achievement, but allowing more middle class voters led to a rise in Liberalism. We now must adapt to this new block."

John Anderson, a former slave of North Carolina, on his way north to Canada for the sake of escaping slavery, killed a man who nearly caught him. Anderson did eventually reach Canada, and was not found and apprehended by Canadian law enforcement for six years. As he is held in our Dominion, we must determine if he should be extradited to the United Kingdom or left for the Canadians to handle."

She was the most cheerful and courageous woman I ever knew" her husband wrote after her death. His great adversary William Ewart Gladstone, who had liked Mary, wrote him a letter of condolence.

 ###Royal Marriages
 britainroyal.1.t:0 "Marriage of Princess Alice"
 britainroyal.1.d:0 "Queen Victoria had expressed her wish that her children should marry for love, but this did not mean that her choice of suitors would necessarily be extended to anybody outside the royal houses of Europe. The Queen instructed her daughter Victoria, to produce a list of eligible princes in Europe. Her search produced only three suitable candidates: the Prince of Orange; and Prince Albert of Prussia. The Prince of Orange recently journeyed to Windsor Castle so that Queen Victoria could look him over in person, but he proved unpalatable to Alice. The prince too showed little interest in Alice, despite strong pressure from his pro-British mother. Prince Albert, too, was spurned, with Prince Frederick of Prussia remarking that his cousin would not do for "one who deserves the very best". Louis of Hesse was also suggested, a minor German royal. Louis visited Windosr, the Prince and Alice got along together. However, the other two Princes would bring a much more powerful alliance compared to the minor German state. Who should Princess Alice marry? The Prince of Orange or Albert of Prussia for a powerful alliance or the Prince of Hesse for love?"
 britainroyal.1.a:0 "Prince of Orange"
 britainroyal.1.b:0 "Prince Albert of Prussia"
 britainroyal.1.c:0 "Prince Louis of Hesse"
 britainroyal.2.t:0 "Marriage of the Prince of Wales"
 britainroyal.2.d:0 "In an effort to change his philandering ways, Her majesty the Queen would like to arrange a marriage for the Prince of Wales. The Queen has got the help of Princess Victoria who has found two suitable options: Princess Alexandria denmark, Victoria found her a perfect match for the Prince. However, this may cause issues with Prussia due to the rising tentions over Schleswig-Holstein. But could bring a strong alliance. The second possible option is Elizibeth of Wied, the Queen stongly favours Elizibeth but she is not to the Prince's "taste". Who should the Prince of Wales marry? The Princess of Denmark for which will likely end in a happy marriage but could cause issues with Prussia? Or Elizibeth of Wied to ensure we do not cause hotile tention between Britian and Prussia?"
 britainroyal.2.a:0 "Alexandria Princess of Denmark"
 britainroyal.2.b:0 "Elisabeth of Wied"
 britainroyal.3.t:0 "Princess Helena Marriage"
 britainroyal.3.d:0 "Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family. The marriage horrified the Princess of Wales who exclaimed: 'The Duchies belong to Papa.' The Crown Princess of Prussia, who had been a personal friend of Christian's family for many years, ardently supported the proposed alliance. Helena was happy with Christian and was determined to marry him."
 britainroyal.3.a:0 "Congratulations"
 britainroyal.4.t:0 "Princess Louise Marriage"
 britainroyal.4.d:0 "Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe: Princess Alexandra proposed her brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark, but this would be unpopular in England. William, Prince of Orange, was also considered a suitor, but he had an extravagant lifestyle in Paris, where he lived openly with a lover. Louise viewed marriage to any prince as undesirable, she wished to marry John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, heir to the Dukedom of Argyll. No marriage between a daughter of a monarch and a British subject had been given official recognition since 1515. Who shall the Princess marry? One of the Princess which will cause major upset somewhere or the British subject which would be the first in over 300 years?"

 britainroyal.5.a:0 "Congratulations"
 britainroyal.6.t:0 "Prince Leopold Marriage"
 britainroyal.6.d:0 "British monarchs should marry into other reigning Protestant families, Victoria suggested a meeting with Princess Helen Frederica, the daughter of George Victor, reigning Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont. However, Leopald was very fond of Mary Baring, daughter of Lord Ashburton, but though she was equally fond of him. Who should the Prince marry? The German Princess or the Noblemans young daughter?"
 britainroyal.6.a:0 "Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont"
 britainroyal.6.b:0 "Mary Baring, daughter of Lord Ashburton"
 britainroyal.7.t:0 "Princess Beatrice Marriage"
 britainroyal.7.d:0 "When Beatrice, after returning from Darmstadt, told her mother she planned to marry, the Queen reacted with frightening silence. Although they remained side by side, the Queen did not talk to her for seven months, instead communicating by note. Queen Victoria's behaviour, unexpected even by her family, seemed prompted by the threatened loss of her daughter. The Queen regarded Beatrice as her 'Baby'. Subtle persuasions by the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who reminded her mother of the happiness that Beatrice had brought the Prince Consort, induced the Queen to resume talking to Beatrice. Queen Victoria consented to the marriage on condition that Henry give up his German commitments and live permanently with Beatrice and the Queen."
