###Italy
ita_flavor.1.t:0 "Società Geografica Italiana"
ita_flavor.1.d:0 "Today, a group of young scholars established the “Italian Geographical Society”. In accordance with the provisions of its Statute, the Italian Geographical Society claims to not concern itself solely with applied research. The main goal of its policy, they argue, is the advancement of geographical knowledge ; expanding, updating or innovating knowledge but also fostering geographic culture and environmental awareness, which always seem too limited and yet are absolutely vital. The Society seeks to foster geographic culture in various ways. The first,obvious and traditional, is that of documentation. The second, more daring route, is that of expedition, adventure, and Pioneering."

news_flavor.4.d:0 "Earlier today, a lecture held by Physicist and Fellow of the Royal Society John Tyndall revealed several worrying and concerning properties of Coal Gas and Ether to be strongly absorptive of the sun's heat. In his lecture, Tyndall explained that \"when the heat is absorbed by the planet, it is so changed in quality that the rays emanating from the planet cannot get with the same freedom back into space. Thus the atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat; but checks its exit, and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet.\""

 #Sepoy
 sepoy.1.t:0 "The Sepoy Mutiny"
 sepoy.1.d:0 "For the last century, the English East India Company has continued to consolidate their rule over the Indian Subcontinent. These once thriving and sovereign peoples of the Rajas have been overpowered one by one, subjugated and conscripted for a power two oceans away and turned into a suffering colony to be exploited and ridiculed.\n \nOur Sepoy soldiers serving the British Crown are treated at best like dogs. The land reforms and taxes of the East India Company have pushed millions to the brink of their livelihoods. Now, the latest insult to the people of India has brought revolt, a rumor that the cartridges needed for the newly introduced Enfield Rifle are lubricated with Pig and Cow Oils. India is Britain’s Crown Jewel but they dare treat our faiths and traditions with such blasphemy!\n \nTens of thousands of Sepoy Soldiers have now mutinied against the British Banner, offering a new hope for the people of India. The Indian people have been oppressed for too long. The time to take action is now and take back our fatherland!"

 sepoy.3.a:0 "Great!"
 sepoy.4.t:0 "Pressure from Sepoy"
 sepoy.4.d:0 "The Rebellion in Sepoy has severely affected our country - even though we are occupied by the British and therefore have to fight for them, our populace is extremely dissatisfied with our decision. The calls for us to abandon the British and join the Sepoy in their rebellion are getting louder and louder - what shall we do?"

 csa.11.t:0 "Flag Referendum"
 csa.11.d:0 "As we go about establishing our new nation, it is customary for every civilized nation to bear a flag to take up arms with and to salute. However, the only flag we have for us is the Bonnie Blue, which was used by the Republic of West Florida and first adopted by the Confederacy with the admission of Mississippi into the Confederacy. However, blue just won't do. That's a Yankee color. So as we work to establish ourselves, we have called a referendum for our people to choose what banner we should take up."

Also attempting to seize the position is Robert Toombs, a former officer and an outspoken critic of Davis. \n \nAlthough he did not run for office, there is also the possibility of Robert E. Lee of being elected as President. Many see him as the new Washington of our nation, and his rejection of running for office is more proof of that. Perhaps history will repeat again? \n \nNevertheless, the choice is now made..."

Also attempting to seize the position is Robert Toombs, a former officer and an outspoken critic of Davis. \n \nAlthough some have attempted to get into contact with him, Robert E.

 csa.22.t:0 "Rebirth of the Whig Party"
 csa.22.d:0 "Thoughts of the Confederacy being a One-Party Democracy are no more. Out of their coffin, the Whig Party has seen a resurgance recently. The Whigs, which were basically the 'We Are Not the Democrats' party, had died out in the Election of 1856 in favor of the Republican Party. Now, it seems as though they are making a comeback, and are taking a more Liberal stance than the conservative Democrats."
 csa.22.a:0 "Interesting..."
 csa.23.t:0 "Our Namesake"
 csa.23.d:0 "There are some Democrats who refused to join us in our fight for independence. The Northern Democrats, who were led by Stephen A. Douglas, betrayed our party. Now they claim to be the true Democratic Party. Naturally, we have far more Democratic Party support in the South, as many Nothern Democrats joined the Republican Party during the Election of 1860. But, there are some who have come up with an idea for a new party, the Dixiecrats. It signifies who we are, but adopting this name would mean that we give up the name and legacy of the Democratic Party to the traitors in the North."
 csa.23.a:0 "We are the true Democratic Party!"
 csa.23.b:0 "Dixiecrat... I like the sound of that!"
 csa.24.t:0 "The Confederacy's Offer"
 csa.24.d:0 "The Confederate States have come to us with an offer: They are requesting a purchase of the states of Sonora and Chihuahua. They have offered us civilian industries and monetary funds in return for the transfer of these states to them. While this will cut us off from Baja California, it would surely help is in any kind of debt we may have to pay off."

 csa.25.t:0 "The Confederacy is about to Purchase Territory!"
 csa.25.d:0 "We have received alarming news from our embassy in Mexico City, where it is reported that the Confederacy is attempting to purchase the states of Sonora and Chihuahua. The Mexicans have accepted this, and in doing so, will give the Confederacy access to the Pacific Ocean. What should we do?"

Instead of a decisive victory for the Germans, it is becoming more and more obvious that Denmark has the upper hand. Pressurized by the European great powers, the devastated Germans were forced to sign a truce with the Danes and agree to the opening of international peace talks which will commence in a week from now. For this purpose, the British foreign secretary Earl Russell has invited the belligerents and other interested parties to London in order to reach an agreement.

Now, the two German hegemons have reached an agreement: they will divide the German Confederation into a North German Confederation under the [PRS.GetName] and a South German Association under the [AUS.GetName]. This means that after 1848, the German Confederation has officially been dissolved for the second time, sanctioned by a decree signed by the Federal Assembly earlier today, which, again, has practically terminated its own existence. The future of Germany now, more than ever, lies in the hands of the two German powers."

However, having the mod on GitHub with that many devs working on it automatically means that it is virtually impossible for us to regularly update the Steam version on the workshop. Consequently, the Steam version is only updated when major updates come out, being the reason for why EoaNB is perceived as \"idle\" or \"dead\" by many when only looking at the workshop page. Still, what has already been explained on the official workshop page is often overlooked.\n\nIf you want to experience an up-to-date End of a New Beginning, the first step would be to join our official Discord (linked on the workshop). After that, you can look up how to install the GitHub version in our #faq channel. Generally seen, the GitHub version of EoaNB is way more developed and advanced than the Steam one.

Nearly two-thirds of our population still make a living through subsistence agriculture, most of them Hungarian. If we expect to become a strong industrial nation in the future, it is of the utmost importance that we begin our attempts to spread industry empire-wide, even though we may be unsuccessful."

 aus.8.d:0 "An issue has been tossed back and forth between our advisors for some time now. Some of our more cultured advisors wish to see additional heritage sites opened across Austria - and perhaps even in other corners of the empire. Doing so would likely raise the happiness and content of the empire, bringing stability and peace to our subjects. \n\nHowever, our other advisors see this as a threat to the country's industrialization efforts. Additional heritage sites would cause the industry to suffer to an extent, which could cause us to be unprepared in the next war, which they predict will be won based on who has the best technology and industry. \n\nThe final decision is now up to you, Kaiser."

 aus.9.d:0 "It is now the year 1857, and although nine years have passed since the Revolutions of 1848, the legacy of the uprisings still scar the empire. Discontent continues in the regions outside of Austria proper, causing many advisors to believe that the central government may be forced to give concessions to the provincial governments in order to prevent a repeat of 1848. With our former ally, Russia, no longer supporting us, it is of the utmost importance that the sentiment of revolution does not stir again, as the empire came close to collapse the last time it did. Oh, Kaiser Franz Josef! Lead the Austrian Empire to glory, unite its people, and bring justice to its enemies!"

 aus.10.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and its inhabitants have brought the Austrian Empire nothing but trouble since 1848. The "Risorgimento" movement for Italian unification has been the worst of our worries regarding the Italian region. For centuries, the Italian peninsula has been split between many kingdoms and has been dominated by foreign powers, such as France or Austria. A unified Italian Kingdom would pose a large threat to current Austrian holdings in Northern Italy. Such a kingdom would also be a large threat to the continuation of the Austrian Empire, as it is highly unlikely that they will be willing to ally us. Therefore, we must do anything in our power to keep resistance to a minimum and to keep a unified Italy from coming to fruition."

Webb argues that the lack of workers in the “northern provinces” is the result of a process of intensifying internal trafficking that transfers all the slave labor to the “southern provinces”, where the large coffee plantations are located. The “northern provinces” are at serious risk of seeing themselves “again” in a situation of barbarism, as they are almost exclusively inhabited by Indians. In order to solve this chronic problem of lack of manpower, it is necessary to transfer African-American workers, who are more adaptable to the soil and tropical climate. These free and paid African-American workers will be responsible for developing the region's resources and infrastructure, they will be under a two to five year employment contract, during which time they must pay the costs of their transportation. After the end of this contract, the worker will receive Brazilian citizenship and a piece of land, thus guaranteeing his interest in staying and developing the region. The Binational Company of colonization of the Amazon basin will be responsible for the supply of labor and for the management of the works carried out in the northern region, while the Empire of Brazil is responsible for giving up the land for development.

The USA has a history of interventionism in foreign territories with American settlers, taking as a striking example the region of Texas that belonged to Mexico. After these settlers' discontent with the local administration, the US openly supported the secession of this region by placing it under its influence zone and subsequently annexing the territory. Although intervention in South America is less likely, it is not impossible to carry out, linked to old documents about Destiny Manifesto, dated 1850, in which Matthew Fontaine Maury, head of the Naval Observatory, proposes a plan for the occupation of the Amazon starting with the settlement of American slaves to "develop" the resources of the region and later taking it by force. So we must be very careful with this type of enterprise."

Much-needed buildings and infrastructure can finally be built.\nThe presence of such a large number of free blacks in the country will affect the Brazilian Empire in many ways, there will be discontent among the slaveholding elite and the increase in the abolitionist movement.\n It is possible that US intervention will take place if the colonists are unhappy with the region's policy and administration.

As 1857 arrives, construction continued under President Montt, finishing in the 15th of Semptember, when the first train finished the Santiago-San Bernardo route. The new station has three structures with 2 offices and 4 railroads."

 chile.2.d:0 "After the high influence of the Church in the government, with the Sacristán Question dividing the conservative party, the government of Manuel Montt and his supporter Antonio Varas, has fallen in support. To combat that, the nationalist and ultraconservatives, have united under one cause, creating the National Party, with a strong executive power, continuing the sponsorship of the church and mantaining order in the collapsing republic."

 chile.4.t:0 "The 1859 Revolution"
 chile.4.d:0 "Since 1851, Chile was governed by war hero Manuel Montt, who stopped the liberal 1851 revolution and ruled with an iron first, persecuting his opposition and divided his party by sponsoring the Church who demoted ministers which the moderate-conservatives supported. With the polarization with the ultraconservatives making the National Party, the liberal-conservative alliance has made the liberal party, allying with the liberal elites in Atacama, who have risen in wealth during the mining boom, with the radical liberals and other dissidents. The explosion of the rebellion happened with the proposal of Antonio Varas, the main authoritharian figure, as a candidate for president. The opposition orchestrated a coup, leading a revolt around the country, specially in the north."

Both climbers were English. Many major Alpine peaks met their first ascents during the period. Although Alfred Will's ascent was not the first one, people commemorate the latter ascent, which marked the start of the Golden Age of Alpinism. The Golden Age of Alpinism was dominated by British Alpine climbers accompanied by Swiss and French guides. The era ended with Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn, which caused death of 4 people; 3 well-known British Alpinists and 1 French Alpine guide.

While the Golden Age of Alpinism (1854-1865) was characterized by the first ascents of many of the Alps' most dominant mountains, the subsequent silver age may be seen as consisting of the first ascents of those few worthwhile peaks left unclimbed, although these peaks were - and remained - largely unknown to the wider public. Many mountaineers from different nations joined the group of leading ascendants of Alps. Although British mountaineers did not dominate the era, still a lot of famous mountaineers in the Silver Age of Alpinism were British, such as Clinton Thomas Dent (1850-1912). His first ascents in the Alps include the Lenzspitze of the Pennie Alps (1870). There is a record that Queen Victoria of the Great Britain had spent her holiday in 1868, in Lucerne, Switzerland.

 britain.24.d:0 "\"On Liberty\" is a philosophical work by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, originally intended as a short essay. The work, published in 1859, applies Mill's ethical system of utilitarianism to society and the state. Mill attempts to establish standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasizes the importance of individuality, which he conceived as a prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the summum bonum of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill criticizes the errors of past attempts to defend individuality where, for example, democratic ideals resulted in the "tyranny of the majority". Among the standards established in this work are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society."

In particular, the so-called “garrotting” cases, where someone strangles someone else, often using their arm or a length of wire, cord, or cloth, seemed to touch the rawest nerve with the people of London, with the fear of garrotting reaching a fever-pitch in the 1860s. The weird thing about garrotting and how widely it was reported at the time is that it doesn’t actually appear to have been all that common; even during the supposed height of the “garrotting panic of 1862”. So why the panic? As it turns out, although garrotting itself was never a major problem in London, newspapers from the era positively loved reporting on it. This led to the few isolated cases that did happen being blown way out of proportion and reported on to such an extent that the people of London were led to believe the streets were filled to the brim with roving rabbles of ruffians armed with lengths of wire."

Now with his death, Morocco is up against new challenges in an age, where even their neighbours are being conquered by invaders from Europe."
Morocco.1.a:0 "Long live Muhammad IV!"

algeria_kabylia.2.d:0 "Today our forces have officially met on the battlefield with the Kabyle tribes, most notably the Ait Icheriden tribe, in the fortified village of Icheriden. The local resistance was led by Lalla Fatma N'soummer following the death of her lover in 1854. Despite her successful use of guerilla tactics, her force was beaten down to about 5000 loyal tribesmen throught the 3 years of warfare, and today is the day we shall win this war."
