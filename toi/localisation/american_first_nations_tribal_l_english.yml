Turns out they weren't dull alcoholics, they were cold men in uniforms with sharp bayonets, and they really didn't want us there. It was dusk when the men from the local camp came to our little boom-town. They came in number, with rifles and pistols, and they told us that we had until sunrise the next day to pack our things and head east. Old Paulie tried to fight back, and they shot him on the spot. That night, the men of the town formed a posse and went to take it up with the natives where they lives, assuming they'd gone back to their teepees. They didn't know that the natives never left.

It was a sunrise seen a thousand times by many, but it shone on a changed land. A few towns over, a railway that headed to the capital was being built. It was like, all of a sudden, the land has surrendered part of it's spirit. Factories became more common now. They sprung up everywhere, so did shops and telegraph offices. It was like, on a walk through the new 'town', you could feel the spirit falling from the land like ashes from a cigarette. But this change, gave a certain momentum to matters, one that struck fear into the hearts of the American settlers.

Slaughtered for their iron roads. Me and my sister bought a ticket each to tonight's showing. It was bad, but it was the kind of bad that just made it fun to watch. We sat in the second row from the front and watched as the actors in cheap costumes began their stilted and awkward opening lines. It was always funny when they screwed up, and it got a few solid laughs. We were halfway through the second act when the town bell rang in alarm. In the distance, the was a loud boom, and then it happened. An American cannonball crashed through the theatre roof, sending splinters of wood and shrapnel flying and filling the air with smoke and dust. There was a crazy rush as the bell rang louder and the cries of attack filled the air. People screamed as they stampeded for the exit. I could hear my sister shouting for me in the chaos. That was the last time I heard her alive. They found her body under the rubble when the dust had settled.

The shack was dark, and dimly lit, but there was still oil in the lamp. Someone was here recently. Around the table there were 3 dead bodies. Two confederate officers, and a comanche. It was obvious what happened. They shot each other, over the bag on the table. As hare approached the table, gunfire ripped through the cabin. The cheap and old wood splintered into toothpicks as he hit the floor. He could hear the strong accents of texans outside. The confederate line had retreated and they were burning everything along the way. A stray bullet knocked the lamp off the side, spilling hot oil that burst into flames as it touched the wick. Soon, the entire shack was engulfed with flames and smoke filled the air. It was gettingg harder and harder to breathe, as the roof started to creak, and the lack of escape was obvious. Hare, slowly coughing, opened the bag on the table. What was it, that caused all of this? What could be so important that it would form the final spark that ignited a powder keg? It was money. Confederate-issued dollars. This...this was worthless. Worthless paper issued by worthless men to trade in worthless cotton.
