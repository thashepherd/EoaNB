	 russia.6.t:0 "Protests Against Vodka!"
	 russia.6.d:0 "Prices for alcohol always were relatively small in Russia from the times of Ivan IV. But with a time that prices increased more and more. Nearly in 1830-1840 years prices have risen to 2-3 rubles per bucket of vodka. This money is also a price for a calf.\nNow it became even worse, as prices for vodka have risen three times as large as they were in the 1850 year. This is because Russia needs to replenish its depleted budget after the Crimean War, but also it causes instability in our states, especially among the poor. Protests against that policy originally started in Kovno Governorate, in Lithuania, where local villagers took oaths to abstain from drinking any high-degree alcohol except for "medicinal purpose". However, wine and beer are still permitted. Locals, supported by the Catholic clergy, established chapters of the Brotherhood of Sobriety, a temperance society that originated in Silesia and has support from the Pope himself. That was at the end of the 1858 year\nFew months ago the situation has become even worse - peasants all around the Empire are taking oaths of abstention from vodka. Boycotts were in 91 uyezds (an area that is part of the governorate) of 32 governorates. Sales of alcohol dramatically decreased, with vodka prices dropped in 16-20 times and retailers sometimes offering vodka for free. Now members of temperance societies attack taverns and destroy alcohol stockpiles. This is going beyond the borders of good and bad..."

It has been handled by the regular army, resulting in 14 peasants being wounded and 7 killed right there, with 3 of the wounded ones dying later. Our company also suffered some casualties - 13 wounded soldiers and 1 killed officer. 60 of 65 peasant defendants were sentenced to death by our court-martial in Tallinn, but later Baltic governor-general Suvorov reduced the sentences of 44 peasants to corporal punishment, 35 of whom were sentenced to leave to Siberia in exile, while the remaining 21 rebels were just set free.

	 russia.20.d:0 "Since 1725, when Peter the Great installed the soul tax, there have been many things happening with his motherland. Crises, wars, and industrial advancements have changed the world and Russia as well. Now soul tax became mostly obsolete even in a modernized state. That's why the government wanted to discuss it with the respective zemstvos of the Russian governorates. One-half of them were supporting graduated from lower to higher people income tax which will be levied upon all the population and will leave the tax income to the state budget the same, but peasants and citizens will live better in cost of some nobility cashes. Some other commissions supported the usual income tax, but only for merchants, and some additional taxes on nobility and peasants. That was quite a crazy and ineffective idea and no one in the government supported it. Also, there was one more proposal - property taxes instead of both soul and income taxes. If you have much property but a low income you should sell some of your things to have lower taxes for them. All things will be levied with those new taxes, from spoons to great estates. This is an unpopular and very untraditional proposal but it gained support through the economically competent people in our lands. Maybe we should listen to them. Or we can just drop all the initiative and suffer the consequences of inefficient tax policy. Nobility will be pleased with that."

Luckily, at just the right moment, the revolutionary’s attempt was thwarted by the valiant interruption of no other than a peasant-born hatter’s apprentice by the name of Ossip Komissarov, who jostled the revolutionary’s arm just as he was about to fire.\n\nThe assailant, shocked by Komissarov, attempted to flee the scene, but he was immediately intercepted by the royal guard. The guards wrested his weapon away from him and confiscated what appeared to be morphine and strychnine to kill himself with, along with prussic acid to disfigure his face. Alexander approached the assailant, and angrily asked him “What do you want?” The shocked assailant only mumbled back to him “Nothing, nothing,” before being taken away.\n\nThe identity of the assailant has been revealed to be Dmitry Karakozov, a former student and a member of the revolutionary students’ organization known as the Ishutin Society, led by Nikolai Ishutin. He has been locked away in the Peter and Paul Fortress awaiting his punishment, but he begs for forgiveness and even offers to convert to Orthodoxy."

The assailant ducked his weapon back into his coat and attempted to flee the scene, but was quickly accosted by the guards and taken away.\n\nAs the crowds gathered around to gaze in horror at their wounded Emperor, the guards desperately attempted to disperse the crowds as a carriage rode up to take him away to the Winter Palace. As the carriage fled the scene, the condition Alexander worsened severely, as he began to cough up blood and grow extremely pale and weak.

The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities, which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways, and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs.

The reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure abolished the system where children were conscripted and resulted in the levy system being introduced in Russia and military districts being created across the country. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army as it continued into the 21st century. Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874, the Russian Army had no permanent barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks."

	 russiabook.1.d:0 "'Russian Bulletin' has sent its new March-April issue to the Censor Department. That would be a usual publication if it hadn't the new Turgenev's novel inside, called 'Fathers and Sons'. Its idea is rotating around nihilism, an ideology of denial of every authority and even somewhat revolutionary! It can be dangerous enough for our aristocracy which already supports liberal ideas. We can give the order - and this book will be completely different, but Turgenev will be completely disappointed in our government. He is one of the most loyal writers of our Motherland and it would be a tall loss. But what if we go soft with this novel and just let it be? Of course, there will be some mimics who will call themselves 'nihilists', but... isn't it what we want to make them think? Just ensure that they are loyal, being initiative and innovative isn't a crime in Russia."
	 russiabook.1.a:0 "Let's not be strict, it's not the Nikolay era after all."

But due to the end of the Censor Department, following the new law about the press, the real book has been revealed! Now people are blaming us for hiding that 'masterpiece' from them. That led to us losing some positions in government and, what is worrying - 'nihilism' starts to spread through our population!"

	 russiabook.3.t:0 "Publishment of 'Crime and Punishment'"
	 russiabook.3.d:0 "Fyodor Dostoevsky has written a new book, called 'Crime and Punishment'. It tells about a poor Russian student, Rodion Raskolnikov, who tries to survive in Saint Petersburg and lends his old but only kettle to the old woman, who was a money lender. He says that this is unfair and kills her along with her silly-minded sister and then tries to merge his philosophy theory about 'the ones who have the right and the ones who don't' with the fact of murder. When he founds his love and starts a more active life, meeting many people, his conscience begins to rise slowly, leading him to surrendering to police and going to penal colony in Siberia. His love follows him and there he finally finds his salvation, throws out his ideas and starts a new life with his woman. This book, being published now in the 'Russian Bulletin', is close to the title of masterpiece and doesn't really tell about any political ideas, so we can just let it be."

	 russiasiberiancolonization.5.d:0 "When Siberian students named Grigory Potanin, Nikolay Yadrintsev, Serafim Shashkov, Nikolay Naumov, Fyodor Usov and other ones came to St. Petersburg in the early 60-s, they immediately created an idea of Siberian independence or 'at least' autonomy for their region. They returned home in 1863, immediately establishing contacts with political prisoners and Polish people who were exiled after their recent rebellion. They were gathering forces and money to incite revolt in Siberia, but at this summer, in the year 1865, their plot was uncovered. Forty four members of the group were arrested and taken to prison by the Russian government in May after watch officers of the Siberian Cadet Corps searched cadet Arseny Samsonov, aged 16, for illicit items and found a proclamation entitled 'To Patriots of Siberia,' attributed to collective authorship of G. Potanin, N. Yadrintsev and other leaders of the movement. Now all of them were sent to various places around the empire for either penal labour or exile, ensuring that we won't hear of them revolting again. Their ideas got some foothold within minds of local bourgeois in Tomsk, Tobolsk and Irkutsk, but that doesn't matter, because no one questions Russian authority in those lands anymore."
	 russiasiberiancolonization.5.a:0 "Good they were arrested."
