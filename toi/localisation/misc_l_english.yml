 raj.0.t:0 "The State Of The Company"
 raj.0.d:0 "The British East India company was founded on December 31st, 1600, as a joint-stock company with the goal of destroying Spanish and Portuguese monopolies on the Indian Ocean Trade. The Company soon eclipsed the Dutch and Portuguese, along with the French after the Seven Years’ War, were they established a monopoly over colonialism in Asia, as well as trade in Asia. Indian opium, tea, silk, and saltpetre gave the company a reliable, convenient, and plentiful source of income. Although everything seemed to be going swimmingly, the situation within the Raj was reaching a boiling point. The British East India Company had been exploiting ethnic, religious, and tribal differences in order to attain control over the subcontinent. The Company had also enacted many unpopular western reforms that went against the beliefs of the locals, and new tariffs, along with other trade restrictions enacted by the crown, would cripple the internal economy of the Mughal Empire, reversing the proto-industrialization that was left over from the Mughal Empire, and the rich and prosperous eternal economy. Famines also became a glaring problem within Indian society, with over 60 million dying in famines between the 18th and 20th centuries. Many of these problems, as well as the introduction of cartridges made of pig skin into the army and the burden of British Rule, would result in the Sepoy Rebellion Of 1857 (Indian Mutiny). This is a decisive moment in British History, as the “Jewel Of The British Empire”, could soon fall back into the hands of the natives, or it could also be the start of an age of brutal repression, with an increased effort to assimilate the Indian subcontinent into the British Empire…"

Thus, the new young emperor Franz Joseph I had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance. Czar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law, because of this a lot of Hungarians have resentment for Austrians and are actively working to sabotage austria control in Hungary."
