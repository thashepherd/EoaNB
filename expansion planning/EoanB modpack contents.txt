    During equipment research, at least 1 event should pop giving choices that impact the result
    i.e. selecting a rigid vs. nonrigid airship, biplane vs monoplane, radial vs inline vs rotary, yada yada
    In an ideal tech, that decision also impacts the name of the equipment that's unlocked
    In an ideal tech, one or two of the options should be gated behind research
	Specific inventions (such as 'Giffard airship', 'Derwitzer glider') can be implemented as events that fire at some random date after the tech has been researched

	A 'develop a new aircraft' decision would be nice (uses latest current tech but allows new decisions)
